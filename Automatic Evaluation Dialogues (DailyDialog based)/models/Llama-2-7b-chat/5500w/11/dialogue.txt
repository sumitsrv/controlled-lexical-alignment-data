Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	😊 Which flower you would like to have in your garden?</i></s>01-01-2023
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	🤔 Ah, the lotus flower! Yes, it's a very symbolic and meaningful flower in many Eastern cultures
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm not saying it's 100% accurate, but the lotus flower does have a rich symbolism that people are drawn
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	The cactus flower? I'm not sure that one is the most personality revealing, it more like you are trying to and with
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 It's like you are not just revealing their personality it's more that the flower is what they think and feel I make sense
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	I think you're overthinking it. It's like personality and flower are two completely different things. And the more you talk with
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
