A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: 😊 which [flower] [you] would _like_ _to_ [have] in your garden ? </i></s>01-01-2023 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: 🤔 ah , [the lotus] [flower] ! yes _, it's_ [a] very symbolic _and_ meaningful [flower] in many eastern cultures 
A|6| Human 1: oh [, it's] _not_ research ! _just_ [a] personal theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ _revealing_ of _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] saying [it's] 100% accurate , but [the lotus] [flower] [does] [have a] rich symbolism [that] [people] [are] drawn 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera _. it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] cactus [flower ?] [i'm] [not] sure [that] one _is_ [the] most [personality] [revealing] , [it] [more] [like] [you] [are] trying [to] [and] [with] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone _what_ _their_ favourite _flower is_ . pretty much [like] _what_ we _just_ did . [does] [that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [you] [are] [not] [just] [revealing] [their] [personality] [it's] [more] [that] [the] [flower is] [what] they [think] [and] feel [i] [make sense] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk with_ [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] of [what] they're [like] , over [the] course of maybe _two_ [to] five years _. and_ voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] you're overthinking [it] [. it's like] [personality] [and] [flower] [are] [two] completely different things [. and] [the] [more] [you] [talk with] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
