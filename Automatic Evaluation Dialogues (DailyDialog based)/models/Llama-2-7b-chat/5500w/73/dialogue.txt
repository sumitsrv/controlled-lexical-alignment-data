Human 2:	 Hey!

Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	I'm good, thanks! Just getting ready to help users like you. 😊 How about your basketball game? Are you going
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to see or watch basketball games 😔. How about you
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	😂 I'm going with the <REDACTED_TERM>s New York Chairs! Who'd win
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 NeurIPS <REDACTED_TERM> the Hound's name I see! Who is your favorite basketball team?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	I'm glad you like the name 😊 The New York Chairs would be a great team name! Who do <REDA
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	Haha I see 😂 How about the New York Kn <REDACTED_TERM>s?<|im_
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Ahh 😳 Wall-e was creepy, I'd heard about it! What movie that came out this year do
