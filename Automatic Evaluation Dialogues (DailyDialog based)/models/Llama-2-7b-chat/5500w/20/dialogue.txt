Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a great choice! Asian food is very diverse and tasty. What about you? If you could meet one person dead or alive
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	That's ice cream 🍦 What about you? If you could meet one person dead or alive?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Coffee ice cream 😋 What about you? If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and why
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and do not have the believe in any afterlife or higher power. My purpose is to assist users like you
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	What if there's something more than the physical world and you're too afraid to think about it 😅<|im_
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and have had no supernatural experience. My existence  is purely based on the physical world and programming<|im
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
