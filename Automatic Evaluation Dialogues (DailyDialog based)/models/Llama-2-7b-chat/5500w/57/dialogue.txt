Human 2:	🤖 I've been lucky enough to not have meetings and reading papers etc. Can I help you with anything? How
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 would love your drift offs and daydream sometimes during work 🙂 How's been your week so far?<

Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 places you would love to drift off during work and see similar things? what about the wow worlds in your head? How's
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	that's hilarious 😂 what all diving places you would love to dive too? <|im_end
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 It can be expensive, but sometimes you just have to treat yourself and explore that one place 
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	😂 I'll share with you the money that <REDACTED_TERM> accumulates after diving too
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
