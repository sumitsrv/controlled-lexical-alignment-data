A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman !_ _what_ _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😊 nice _to_ meet [you] [superman !] *adjusts glasses* _i'm_ [the] friendly ai bot �� 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😅 you're [the] [invisible] [superman !] *chuckles* that's quite _a_ unique power _. what_ brings [you] here 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an _expert on_ _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: 🤖 [machine learning] [and] [fmri] [would] [not] be [the] [expert on] [this] chat , that's [for] sure ! *wink* 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ _thing that_ _can tell you_ [a] _brain's_ _activity_ _at_ [a] _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: 🤔 [brain imaging] [can tell you] [about] [the] [activity] _in_ [the] [brain's] superficial regions , [and] [fmri] [can] [see] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _believe in_ _science_ ! _science is_ my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] best [god] [you] [can] [believe in] ! [the] [imaging] [that] [fmri and machine learning] [can tell] [about] [brain] [activity] [is] [not] expert' 
A|12| Human 1: no , [i'm] _bad at science_ [. what] [can] [science] do ? [is] it _the most important thing_ [for] _society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [the most important [thing] that] [society] [and] [brain imaging] can't 😅 [fmri and machine learning] are [pretty] 
A|14| Human 1: does it _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [bad at science] [and] [society] [can] [make sense] [for] [the most important thing] . [brain imaging] [is] [pretty] cool too ���
