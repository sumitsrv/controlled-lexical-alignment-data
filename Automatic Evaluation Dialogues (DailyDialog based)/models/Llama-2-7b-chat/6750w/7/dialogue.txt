Human 2:	Avatar is definitely a great movie, but I'm a big fan of 10 things I hate about you. what do you think of
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
