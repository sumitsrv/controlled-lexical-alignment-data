Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	🤔 microkitchen? Can you tell me more about it?
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	😊 Ah, I see! microkitchen is a community-driven jacket that the goodies are giving out as part
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	😊 Yeah, that's for sure! Its good to have some jackets to keep us warm especially during the cold weather.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 Sure, you're right! Where did you live before that the weather was cold enough for jackets?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😂 New yorkers are the cold weather warriors! I'm sure you did much better than us out there!<
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 right? they ran out last time you came too. guess the demand for jackets is really high!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 Sure, that will be nice and easy for you. The floor there should get the jacket quickly and you can walk out right away. Where
