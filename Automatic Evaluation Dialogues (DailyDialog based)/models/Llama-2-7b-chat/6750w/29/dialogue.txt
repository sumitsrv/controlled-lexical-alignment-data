Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm going great 😊 How cool is AI? It's amazing how far it has come.
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI working part time 😂. How cool is that you are studying something interesting? Are you going
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I work full time but take pottery classes from time to time sounds way better that's cool you working part time How was your day going
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	😂 that's cool For some reason I was imagining you working like a sewing factory but pottery class sounds way better
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 It's great that you get to make tea ware! What kind of pottery do you like the most? Are you also part time
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Ahh white teas are the best 😍 What kind of pottery do you like working on the most? I'm mostly
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	<REDACTED_TERM> 😂 that sounds like a great channel! I love tea and pottery, can'
