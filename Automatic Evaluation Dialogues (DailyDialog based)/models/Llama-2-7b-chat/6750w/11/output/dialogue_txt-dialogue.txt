A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 🤔 _that's a_ great question ! _i_ [have] been trained _on a_ wide variety _of_ topics , including _flower preferences_ . however , 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working [on a] theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: 🌸 [i'm] glad you're interested in [the lotus] [flower] ! _it_ _is_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ growth , renewal , 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! _just_ [a] personal theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower preferences] _are more_ _revealing_ [of] _personality_ _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure [that] [the lotus] _flower is_ [revealing] [personality] . [just] [think] _it_ looks [more] _pretty_ [than] other flowers ! *gigg 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if _you_ _drew_ "flower" _with_ [a] _crayon and_ _then it came to life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's not] [that] [i think] [it] [revealing] [personality] . [the gerbera] [and] [the lotus] [flower] [are more] [like] bookends [of] [preferences] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , _you_ ask someone what their favourite [flower is] . [pretty] much [like] what we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [you have] [crayon and] [drew] [flower] [with] [that] [then it came to life] [step] [are more] [the] [preferences] [revealing] [personality] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . [step] 2: _talk with_ [the] person _some_ [more] , [and] ask _them_ _some_ [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] _course_ [of] maybe _two_ [to] _five_ years . _and voila_ 
B|13| Human 2: [and voila] [you have] [some] [flower] [and] [personality] [preferences] [revealing] [the] [more] they [talk with] [them] [over] [a] years' [course] [like] [two] [five] [that] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
