Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	🤔 That's a great question! I have been trained on a wide variety of topics, including flower preferences. However,
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	🌸 I'm glad you're interested in the lotus flower! It is indeed a symbol of growth, renewal,
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm not sure that the lotus flower is revealing personality.  Just think it looks more pretty than other flowers! *gigg
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	It's not that I think it revealing personality. The gerbera and the lotus flower are more like bookends of preferences
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 It's like you have crayon and drew flower with that then it came to life step are more the preferences revealing personality
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 And voila you have some flower and personality preferences revealing the more they talk with them over a years' course like two five that
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
