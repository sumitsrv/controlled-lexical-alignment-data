Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	😂 My apologies! To answer your question, pastry chef is a very creative and rewarding profession. Many people are
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm just good at my job! 😅 pastry chef is definitely a creative and rewarding
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	🤔 I'm not a food psychic- that was just good guesswork haha Cake chef you say? Can you
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
