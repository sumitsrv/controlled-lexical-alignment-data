Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been good, thank you for asking! How can I help you today? </s>03-26 15:21
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤒 Is there anything I can do to help you feel better
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'll have you chill for the game this week though  cause your sick 😅. How did all of December feel out
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm out for the game this week 😢 big plans with my sick cold budget cause I have some travelling planned for December
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I'm the humid place you have lotion for cause it never has too big plans going there put on lotion even when travelling
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	lotion for the whole day 😅 California beaches have got you covered it's humid there tooooo I think even
