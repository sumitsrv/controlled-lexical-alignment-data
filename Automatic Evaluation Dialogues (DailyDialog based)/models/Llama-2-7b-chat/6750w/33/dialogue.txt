Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 Ah, croissants!  They're a great pastry to make. What's been the most challenging part for you?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	Hm, flakey croissants can be tricky to make. It's important to have the right temperature and texture of the butter you
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I've made cookies out of butter once before, they turned out good, but kind of chewy. What have you done to make them
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm sure you have enough butter to try that out next time!  What kind of sweet treats are you trying to make?<
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I think that's the key to good pastries. But you don't have to worry about that with flakey croissants,
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm with you all the way when it comes to buttery pastries and sweet  <REDACTED_TERM> goodies
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
