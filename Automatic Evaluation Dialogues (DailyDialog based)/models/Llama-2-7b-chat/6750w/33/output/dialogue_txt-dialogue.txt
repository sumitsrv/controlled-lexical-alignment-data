A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! they're _a_ [great] pastry [to make] . what's _been_ _the_ most challenging part for _you_ ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done_ _them_ _once_ or twice so far _, but_ _they_ haven't [been] _flakey_ _enough_ . _i'm_ _trying to_ figure _out_ why _. _what_ kind of_ _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: hm , [flakey] [croissants] can be tricky [to make] . [it's] important [to] [have] _the_ right temperature _and_ texture [of] _the_ butter [you] 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [made] [cookies] [out] [of] butter [once] before , [they] turned [out] [good] [, but] [kind of] chewy [. what] [have you] [done] [to make] [them] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] [good] idea . i'll give _it_ [a] _try_ _next time_ . would [you] say _you have_ [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] sure [you have] [enough] butter [to] [try] [that] [out] [next time] ! [what kind of] [sweet] treats are [you] [trying [to] make] ? < 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me too , _i think_ i'd eat _pastries_ _all the_ [time] if _i_ could get away _with_ _it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] _that's the_ key [to] [good] [pastries] . [but] [you] [don't] [have] [to] worry about [that] [with] [flakey] [croissants] , 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was _when_ _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [with] [you] [all the] way [when] [it] comes [to] buttery [pastries] [and] [sweet] [<redacted_term>] goodies 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe [that's the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
