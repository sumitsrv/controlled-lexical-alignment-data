A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what do you_ think _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: _great_ ! 🤖 [chat bots] [like] me _are_ _the_ future _of_ customer service ! 💬 [what] _can_ _i_ help [you] _with_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed to have made some [great] _progress_ over last few years . _do you_ think [the] _positives_ outweigh [the] _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: 🤔 [positives] [like] _more_ efficient customer interactions _and_ [negatives] [like] [the] potential for over-reliance _on_ [bots ?] [what do you] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination _? though it sounds far fetched :)_ 
B|7| Human 2: [like] impersination [? though it sounds far fetched :)] [what] [about] [the] possibility _of_ [bots] overtaking [human] jobs [like] telemarketers 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some [of] these [bots] [are] very _engaging_ [and] _funny_ . they [are] now _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ [far] [are] we from [the] time these [bots] start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: 🤖 [monologues] [like] [the] [good] ol days [of] [chat bots ?] 😅 [funny] [and] [engaging] [are] [great] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think [it] [can] take many different forms as a product . _the research implication_ is _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ _signify how_ ai _research_ _has_ progressed so [far] [and] _better place_ to _tackle more futuristic problems_ 🙂 _sort of _like_ stepping on_ [the] _moon_ 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the research implication] [will] [also] [signify how] [the] [progress] [has] [better place] [tackle more futuristic problems] [like stepping on] [moon] [sort of like] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ _auto-suggestions_ _already_ [do] _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [auto-suggestions] [are] [pretty good] [already] [that] [the current] [research] [can] [tackle more futuristic problems] [like] impersination [and] monolog
