Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and would love to join you for the trip around Christmas! However, I'm a large language model,
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I'm afraid I have the know-how and physical capacity to join you for events around Christmas eve; then again, they would want Disney
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Great idea! Traffic might be harsh around Christmas eve and the 26th as they will have loads of events for Disneyland fun
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Airbnb might not have the same Disney fun for Christmas eve and 26th that you want. Let me inquire about events around
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point. Christmas eve and 26th might not have events in Disneyland that would work for you. Let me look around for Air
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	<REDACTED_TERM> year old Disney fan and you are getting for your 3rd grade student this time?<|im
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 Great! What are you looking for in Disneyland this time around? Likewise <REDACTED_TERM> legos would work
