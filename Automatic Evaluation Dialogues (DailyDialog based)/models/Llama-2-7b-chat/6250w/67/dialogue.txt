Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	😱 That's great! Are you ready for an adrenaline rush? I can give you instructions on how to
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Seville is nice 😊 I'm sure you'll have a great time skydiving there. What made you want to
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Yes  I'm feeling a little trepidatious, too! Have you done skydiving before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm a little nervous for you 😅 Have any sports before?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Haha you're definitely  more adventurous than I am! Have you tried any water sports before?
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	I tried water sports once and definitely was able to stay afloat for the whole class 😅 Have you done any extreme sports before?
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
