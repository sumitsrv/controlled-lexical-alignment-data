Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'm here to help.  Please go ahead and describe the scenario you've been pondering.<|im_end
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I see. It's not uncommon for friendships to become strained during conflicts like the one you described.  But it's great
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	That's understandable.  It can be difficult to bring up the issue with someone if their friendship has been strained already<|im_
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone's friend because they might have their sides already lol That's like good advice though,
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's like they say what the balance but never find out how it all works! Lol I have not been that good with friends lately
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 Lol That's the right balance for single friends though lmbo I used to find it but now I have a lot of other things
