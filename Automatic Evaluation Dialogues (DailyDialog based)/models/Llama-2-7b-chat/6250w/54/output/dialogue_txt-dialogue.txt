A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello there , how is _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _great_ . i _just_ won _a_ _pingpong_ _game _. what_ about you ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: that's [great] _to_ hear ! 🎉 [pingpong] is [a] _fun_ [game . what] made [you] start playing ? <|im_ 
A|4| Human 1: no , very rarely . _it's_ kind of amazing _that_ i won _, but_ _i'm_ still _taking credit for_ [it] . 
B|5| Human 2: 😂 [it's] [great] [that] you're [taking credit for] _your_ win ! [what] do [you] _like_ _to_ do in _your_ free time ? 
A|6| Human 1: haha thank _you ,_ i guess _i'm just_ [a] natural . what's [your] _favourite game ?_ 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm just] an ai that's always learning _and_ improving [. what about you ?] [favourite game ?] do [your] friends call [you] 
A|8| Human 1: what's _racquetball_ [like] ? from context clues , [i'm] guessing [that] [it] involves _hitting_ [a] _ball_ _with_ [a] racquet 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm just] [like] [you [,] but] [with] some ai magic in [that] [racquetball] [game] ! [it] was [great] [hitting] [that] [ball] back _and_ forth 
A|10| Human 1: wow ! [a] _cage match_ ! _does_ [it] _get physical ?_ 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm just] [that] _good_ 😅 [does] [your] [racquetball] [game] [get physical ?] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] sounds [fun] . i think of _tennis_ itself as being _really_ athletic [and] tiring , so i _don't_ think [it's] [a] sport [for] me , _though_ ! 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [like] 99 . 9% sure [that] [tennis] [and] [racquetball] [don't] [really] [get physical] [with] [cage match] [though] � 
A|14| Human 1: [what] [a] [good] idea , i'd love [to] !
