B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! 🥯 they're _a_ [great] challenge _, but_ [i'm] sure you'll [make] _them_ beautifully 
A|4| Human 1: i've done [them] once _or_ twice so far [, but] _they_ _haven't_ been flakey enough . [i'm] trying _to_ figure _out_ why . _what kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai [, but] _i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] [or] [croissants] personally . however _, i_ can _give_ [you] _some_ [great]

B|11| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to] [try] [that] [next time] [with] [pastries] [too] ! [what kind of] [great] tips do [you] [think] [could] [people] [give] [out] about [all the] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last_ [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ when _<redacted_term>_ _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ [all the time] we [have] today ! [it] [was] [great] [<redacted_term>] [and] [pastries] [the last]
