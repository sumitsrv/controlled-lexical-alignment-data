B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ delicious _breakfast_ , which always sets _the day_ up _right_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that_ ! [breakfast] _is_ [the] most important meal _of [the_ day] , after _all_ . _do you_ _have_ any _other_ questions _or_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ had _eggs and hash browns_ . way less _healthier than_ _your_ _apple_ , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: _oh ,_ [eggs and hash browns] _are_ [a] [great] [breakfast] choice ! they're high _in_ protein [and] can give _you_ [the] energy _you_ need _to_ start [your] 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's true_ . if [you] could only eat _one_ _food forever_ , _what_ _would_ _it_ _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai [a] little [healthier than] [eggs and hash browns] _would be_ [apple] [forever] ! 😋<|im 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange [would be] [a] drawback ! [that] turns my mind [to] nutrition so _i_ suddenly _want_ [to] _say_ _soylent_ [or] _one_ [of] those [other] "complete foods" , which _i_ _think defeats_ [the] _purpose_ [of _the] question_ . [i'm] [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [that's true] [and] [i] [say] [that] [a] complete [food] [soylent] [would be] [the] [one] [i] [want] [forever] ! [it] [think defeats] [purpose] [question] [right] 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] _love it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] [love it] ! [soylent] [and] [other] complete foods [would] definitely make [the question] [a] bit tricky 🤔 [that] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . _what_ sort [of] [food] [do you] _feel like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai [i] don't [feel like] anything [what] [do you] [think] [would be] [the] healthiest [food forever] ? that<| 
A|14| Human 1: [oh ,] too easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . [all] their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
