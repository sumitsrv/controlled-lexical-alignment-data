Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 It's going good! Just got back from a meeting with the team. How about you? What have you been up to?<|
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Haha, you're right! 😅 indoors all day? You know me, the same old meetings and work
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	You're the funny one 😂 What beach you need tan from? Hahaahh
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	🤔 you're pretty good at that fish researcher joke hahaha. Just some beach workouts and fun in the
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	Hahaah very dangerous 😂 you're funny! Woah that sounds like some kind of water sports or beach workout
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Hmmm that's very interesting 😮 but dangerous work like mountain climbers you say? Sounds not good hahahaha
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually pretty scared of heights 😅 but yes indoor climbing gyms are a great way to start
