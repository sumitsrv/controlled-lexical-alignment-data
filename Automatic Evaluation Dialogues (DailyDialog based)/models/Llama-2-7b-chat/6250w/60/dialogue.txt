Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a challenging but rewarding activity. How was your experience?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	What movie theater was that?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah nice! Lots of twists and turns can make for a great movie experience. What's your take on the ending? 
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hahah that's good and all but it can also be fun when it's dark out!  What was the scary movie called
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I see and that's the same here! Where are you originally from? Australia can be fun when it's not winter  But nice lights
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I see. Australia's southern lights are definitely nice too! But good question. How was the movie you saw?  What did you like about
