Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	Yes,  I have been training consistently and have noticed improvements in my time.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	Yes,  I have the marathon coming up in a couple of months time, and I am planning to participate in it.<|im_
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Spartan race you're doing the 10k and not the marathon
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Its fun and challenging but not overly difficult like marathons which are high on endurance but low on obstacles abt 3-
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	February  you're doing the Spartan race and not marathons, for next one which is in Monterey in February<|im
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	1-2 months training for Spartan race can help you prepare but the amount of time It's lot about technique and not just endurance
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	2-3 sessions for training workout It's lot about technique and not just endurance which you can practice with the help of San Jose
