Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	Yes, that's correct! NeurIPS stands for the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, which is one of the premier conferences
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Wall-e? I'm not familiar with that movie, but I can tell you about NeurIPS! 😊<
