B|5| Human 2: aww , 🤒 [sorry [to hear] you're] feeling under [the] weather . _yes_ , [holidays] _can_ [definitely] be [a] busy [and] 
A|6| Human 1: _definitely _!_ _i_ know_ _a lot of_ folks travel [for] _the holidays_ , [but i'm] happy [to] stay home myself !

A|8| Human 1: me too . now [i] [have] folks come visit me [for] _the holidays_ ! [but] _that's_ [also] _tiresome_ .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [hear] [tiresome] [but] [the holidays] are [also] [a] time [for] relaxation [and] spending [with] loved ones<|im_end| 
A|10| Human 1: [yes] ! we set up an _eco-friendly_ (i . e . fake) _christmas_ _tree_ [and] put up some colorful led _lights_ _which_ _is_ _very festive_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [definitely !] [there's] something about [the holidays] _that_ [just] makes [you] [want to] be [around] people [and] [have] fun<|im_end| 
A|12| Human 1: buying [a] _tree_ _is_ [a] neat experience . [i] was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one [that] smells _like_ fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] one [that] we [can] disassemble every year . 
B|13| Human 2: [yes] , [that's] [a] _great_ idea [! i] [also] [like] [the] [eco-friendly] [tree] option [which] [can] be reused [for] years [and] [also] [has] 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , _very_ clever pun [! i] [like] it ! depends . [i] remember having real _christmas_ trees from childhood , [but] these days [with] climate change , _i think_ not chopping down [a] [tree] [just] [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in [a] month _is_ [the] _more responsible_ thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] [the] [eco-friendly] [tree] option [is] [more responsible] [and] sustainable [but] [also] [very festive] decoration [for] [christmas] [holidays]
