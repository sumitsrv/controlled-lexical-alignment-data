Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	Haha thought so eitherways was funny! But it was  cook from outside
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	got you! Thanksgiving with chicken, I like the way you roll 😅
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Oh fun games you ask 😂 I played the turkey chase with a small bird outside our oven... did not end well
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	that sounds like a lot fun 😃 I played games with the kids and did some arts and crafts. Did you have any
