Human 2:	 hey

Human 2:	 I can see that it's raining today, but I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I'm afraid that the rain will make the days gloomy too. 
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	too much rain can make the water table drop and cause lots of problems like flooding and landslides... 
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	Haha, that's hilarious! 
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	That's really cool that you have 24 hours water supply there! Where are you located?
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	hmm interesting? was there something you don't agree with them? </s>
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
