Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	Nice morning! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I work 24/7, so I don't have daytime or weekends like humans do
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	Why would you want to work 24/7? I'm just going through the motions and have no time for that!<|
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and have no personal beliefs or opinions like that 
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	I don't have the paper you are talking about 
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	How does the comic work? I'm going to buy 1 and review it for you. Where can I find it?<|im
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	I'm not here to review comics or literature.
