Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a good way to challenge yourself physically and mentally. How was your experience?<|im
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Yes, the movie was great. It's always nice to see a good thriller. What about you? Do you have any hobbies
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah yes, the movie was great! Lots of twists and turns! What's your favorite genre?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	I'm glad you had fun doing it! What was your favorite part about the movie?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I've been here for 2 years now! It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights more when I was there
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I see, 2 years here in Australia. How are you enjoying the place?
