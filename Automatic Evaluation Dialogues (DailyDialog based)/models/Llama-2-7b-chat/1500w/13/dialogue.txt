Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	It's on my list! What did you think of it?
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	Well, I watched  "The Last of Us" series last weekend. The story and characters are really great! What did you do?<
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 What a great show! The last episode was on the edge of my seat! Do you have a favorite character? I like Baby Yoda and
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	Marvel fan big time!  I saw the last episode of the loki series and I loved it! What did you think of it? Are you
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I can see why you'd think that! Marvel movies can be intense and scary at times, but they also have inspiring messages
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I think the actor playing loki is really good looking! But I can see how you might not find him appealing<|im_end
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki is the name or the actor that I think  was good looking haha
