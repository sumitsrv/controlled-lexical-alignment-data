Human 2:	That's awesome! Are you training for the tournament this weekend? How's your jiu jitsu going?<|im_
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm actually still pretty shaky on the ground haha but I just have fun and try my best
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Yeah, I'm still training and have not competing in long time but the tournament this weekend will just put it myself out there and see
