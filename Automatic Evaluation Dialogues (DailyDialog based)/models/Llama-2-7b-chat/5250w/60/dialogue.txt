Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going good! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! rock climbing can be a challenging but rewarding activity. How was your experience?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	What movie theater do you go to?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 Hahaha yes they can be very twists and turns! What are your favorite movie theaters that you went to?<|im_
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	What's your favorite movie theater that you went to? it can be scary when dark out  but fun and good question<|im
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I've been all over the world! But when it comes to movie going, you are not very good with that.  Where can you see
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Yes I can definitely see the southern lights from Australia it's very nice and fun too visiting over  there
