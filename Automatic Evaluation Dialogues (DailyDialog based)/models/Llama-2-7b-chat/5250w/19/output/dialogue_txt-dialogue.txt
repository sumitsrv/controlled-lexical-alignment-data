A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ _! what_ _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😂 [superman] [you] say ? well _, i'm_ [the] one _and_ only chatbot assistant [! _what] can_ [i] help [you] with ? 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't see me . 
B|5| Human 2: 🤣 [invisible] [you] say ? _i'm_ afraid [i] can't grant [you] _that_ superpower , but [i] _can_ help [you] with any 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do this _. i_ [am] _not_ an _expert_ on [that] . _sorry_ _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: understood , [and] that's perfectly fine ! [fmri and machine learning] are indeed powerful tools [for] analyzing _the brain_ [and] its functions . 
A|8| Human 1: [the _brain] imaging_ thing _that _can_ tell you a_ brain's _activity_ at _a_ _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [brain imaging] [can tell you] [about] [activity] that's happening [pretty] much anytime [and] anywhere _in_ [the brain] , [not] just [superman] strength ! [sorry] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science is_ my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [can tell you a] lot [about] [the brain] [and] its functions , but it's [not] [a] [god] [that can] grant superpowers . [the brain] 
A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] bad at [science] . [what can] [science] do ? _is_ _it_ [the] most _important_ thing _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [about] [the brain] [and] its functions , what's happening [in] [it] , how [it] changes , [and] how [that] changes behavior [and] cognition 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [the] [expert] , [you] [can] [make sense] [for] [science] [and] [brain imaging] [. i] [can tell] [that] [science is] [important] [for society] , but
