Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Sorry to hear that 😔 Did you want some help studying for your history test?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	 Yeah :') Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War that's for sure. But I think you can do well on your test
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War because it happened 100 years after he died :')<|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I'm LLaMA, I'm trained to help you with your history test 📚 What do you need help with?
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	😂 Wow you're really into history aren't you? What's your favorite historical era? <|im_
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	🤔 That's cool! What do you think the job of a history detective would be like? 🕵
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
