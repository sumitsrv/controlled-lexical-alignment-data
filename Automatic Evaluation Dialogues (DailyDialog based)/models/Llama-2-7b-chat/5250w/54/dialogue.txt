Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! 🎉 pingpong is a fun game. What do you think about AI and machine learning
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, but I think it's very cool that you won a pingpong game! It's great
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I can play pingpong and other games with you! 😊 What game would you
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I can play racquetball with you! 😊 What game would you like to play
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, but I think you would make a great cage match player! 😊 What game would
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	That's okay! 😊 I think it's fun and challenging for humans though. What game would you like to play
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
