A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you think_ _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ [chat bots] [like] me _are_ cool ! 😊 _they_ _can_ help [you] _with_ _a_ lot _of_ things [like] answering questions , providing information 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to have_ made _some_ _great progress_ over last few years . do _you think_ _the positives_ _outweigh the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: it's [great progress] [you think] 😊 [what] [positives] _and_ [negatives] [have] [chat bots] [like] me [outweigh [the] positives] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? _though it sounds far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [like] impersination [though it sounds far fetched] 😂 [what] [about] [the] loss _of_ personal touch _and_ [human] connection ? <|im 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! _some_ [of] these [bots] [are] very engaging [and] funny . [they] [are] _now_ _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ [far] [are] we _from_ _the time_ these _bots start giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [some] [are] [good] [now] 😂 [like] [the time] [bots start giving monologues] [like] in [some] sci fi movies ��� 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] research _implication_ is _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ signify _how_ ai research has progressed so [far] [and] better place _to_ tackle _more_ _futuristic problems_ 🙂 sort [of] [like] _stepping_ on _the moon_ 🙂 [i] might be _overselling_ [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 🤖 [the moon] [stepping] [and] [the] [futuristic problems] [sounds] [like] [great progress] [will] [have] [implication] [that] [can] [far] [from] [overselling] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [bots] [can] [also] [progress] [to have] [more] product-oriented [implication] [like] [how] [the current auto-suggestions] [are] [pretty good] [already] [and] 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , _pretty far fetched_ 🙂 nice _having this_ _conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [good] [conversation with you] [haha] [pretty far fetched] [having this] [bots start giving monologues] [like] in [some] sci-fi movies [and] [progress]
