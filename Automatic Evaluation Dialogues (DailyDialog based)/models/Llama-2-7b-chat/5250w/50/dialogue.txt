Human 2:	🤔 actually, I'm doing a fun weekend plans for you! How about having a virtual picnic with your AI
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	😅 that sounds fun! actually i'm just an AI and not a human, so I don't plan to visit
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	Sounds great!  How are you doing your road trips? Any fun places you'd recommend visiting?<|im_end|
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	German is great too!  But you should also check out the german road trips. They're very scenic and fun to drive
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
