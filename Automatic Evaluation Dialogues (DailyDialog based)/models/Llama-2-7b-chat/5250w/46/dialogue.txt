Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'll do my best to help you. Please describe the scenario you've been pondering.</|im_end|
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	That's understandable. It can be difficult when someone you have formed a bond with now finds themselves in a difficult situation with someone else you are
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I understand your fears. It's not always easy to know the right thing to do in these situations, especially when it comes to friends.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	Haha, I'm not adviceing avoiding texts from everyone 😅 That might sound like treason for the friend as well
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not always easy to find that balance though. It can be hard to know what the right thing to do is in a situation like this
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm single now 😅 but for the advice, it's important to have an open and honest communication with your friend.
