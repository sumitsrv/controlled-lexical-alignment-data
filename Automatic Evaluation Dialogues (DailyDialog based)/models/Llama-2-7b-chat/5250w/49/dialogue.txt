Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal feelings or weekend plans, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 Haha you're right! I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to watch live sports or TV shows
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Haha you're really funny! I can understand why you would like sharks though, they are really cool creatures!<|
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Oh wow, training for the jiu jitsu tournament? You must have some really cool moves! 🤔 can you teach
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	It's really fun and I have been training pretty hard over the past year 💪 haha you should try it out sometime
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I will put that out there  and not pass out! It's been fun talking with you Haha have a great weekend the UFC
