Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and don't have a physical body, so I can't actually run marathons. However,
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal plans or events to attend. However,
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	That's great! Spartan races can be challenging and fun, but they can also be quite tough. It's important to train
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	It's definitely not for the faint of heart! but obstacle courses like Spartan race and marathons are great ways to challenge yourself and
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	February is a bit far away, but I'll keep that in mind for next year. Are there any events coming up soon?<|im
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	Absolutely! It's good to practice technique and workout regularly for 1-2 months before the race. Its time-consuming
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Awesome! Will you like to practice with the group next time for 2-3 hours? It's good to workout with others and
