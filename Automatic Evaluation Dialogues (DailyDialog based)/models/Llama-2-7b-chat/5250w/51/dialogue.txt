Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴 horse racing is quite popular, isn't it? How about we chat about something else? 
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's great that you're catching up with friends! How about some other things you like to do in your free time?<
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	actually I'm going fishing with some friends next week 📦 but since that's on my bucket list, deep sea fish
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm thinking about going to that  downhill bike park with some friends. Have fun before you sea sickness haha<|im
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going there too but its super far away 🚗 any good spots you can recommend that are closer?
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm actually the opposite 😂 Tokyo itself is far down my list because its super overpriced there haha. What about
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	What about you've been there  before though? I think the iconic Tokyo Tower should make any list! its such a city like New York
