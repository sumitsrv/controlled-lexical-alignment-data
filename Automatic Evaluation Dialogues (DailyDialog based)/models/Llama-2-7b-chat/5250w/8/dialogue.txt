Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have weekends or personal experiences, but I'm here to help you with any questions
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤒 How are your symptoms? And don't worry
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have the budget for it 😊 travelling can be tiring but exciting too. How did your year
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm just the AI 🤖 have you plans for December?
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I'm going there this year for the first time with my love cause it's been too humid here. It good you never have
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 good for you brooo👍 lotion is important for your skin's health have fun in Hawaii I
