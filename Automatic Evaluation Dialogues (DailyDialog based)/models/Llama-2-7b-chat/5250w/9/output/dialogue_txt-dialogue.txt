B|5| Human 2: [sorry to hear you were sick] _too_ ! 🤒 _yes_ , [the holidays] are [just] [around] [the] corner [and] _i'm_ [definitely] [going] 
A|6| Human 1: [definitely] _! i_ know _a_ lot _of_ _folks_ travel _for the holidays_ , _but_ [i'm] happy [to] _stay home_ myself ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [the] same 😅 [definitely] [stay home] [and] [relax] [with] [the] fam ! [how] [was] [your day] ? did [you] [want to] [plan] something

B|13| Human 2: 🤔 [that's] [very] [eco-friendly] [of] [you] [! [i] was] thinking [the] smell [of] [fresh pine] [can] [also] help

[i] remember _having_ real [christmas] trees from childhood , [but] _these days_ [with] _climate change_ , [i] think _not_ chopping down [a] tree [just] [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in [a] month is [the] more _responsible thing to do_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [yes] 💚 [that's] [very] [eco-friendly] [and] [responsible thing to do] [these days] , [with] [the] [climate change] [going] on [having]
