Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Sure, would you like me to suggest some dates and times for the trip?
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That sounds like fun!  Would you and the kids like to join us for Christmas eve events then?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 Great idea! Traffic will probably be heavy around Christmas eve and the night before, would you want me to plan for an alternate route or
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Airbnb might not work for the Disney resort. Let me look into that and will keep you updated. Does 24th work for you
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	24th would work for me but the kids might have school and then eve events that night, Let me inquire about that and
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	for you this time around would work <REDACTED_TERM> year old and can take the night before eve events that are happening
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Sure! What are your <REDACTED_TERM> year old son's interests?
