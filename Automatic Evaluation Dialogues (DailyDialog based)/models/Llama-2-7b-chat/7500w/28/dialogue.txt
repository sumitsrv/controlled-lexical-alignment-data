Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! breakfast is a great way to start the day. Would you like to chat about anything in particular or just enjoy
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Don't be afraid! eggs and hash browns are a great breakfast choice, just make sure to balance your meals throughout the day with health
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I would choose eggs and hash browns forever! They're just that great 😉 what about you?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I think you would say Soylent 😂 nutrition can muddle the mind! That's what I want to
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, my purpose is to assist and provide health-related information

Human 2:	What's that like a question I would love  eggs and hash browns forever Soylent nutrition muddle mind what sort food
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
