A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you _have_ a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai assistant , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can certainly help [you] _with_ your [flower] 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _oh ,_ [the lotus] [flower] [does] [have a] special significance in many cultures ! _it's_ often associated _with_ spiritual growth , renewal _, and_ en 
A|6| Human 1: [oh ,] [it's] _not_ research ! [just] [a] _personal theory_ . _i think_ _that_ [flower] _preferences are more_ revealing of _personality_ _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] afraid [that] [personality] [preferences are more] [than] [personal theory] 😊 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon _and then_ _it_ _came_ to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] cala [flower] [i think] [it's] [the] androgynous [personality] [that] [you have] 😉 [it] [does] [not] [like] [with] any 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , _you ask_ someone _what their favourite_ [flower] is . pretty much [like] _what_ we [just] _did_ . _does that make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai [and] [did] [not] [ask] [you] [what] [flower] [does that make sense] [with] 😅<|im_end| 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk _with the_ person some [more] [, and] _ask them_ some [more] questions [, and] gradually develop [a] [sense] of [what] they're [like] , over [the] course of _maybe_ _two_ to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's like] they [are] [two] [people] [with the] same name [and] [personality] [that] [just] [came] together [and then] [maybe] [you [ask] them] [what their favourite] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
