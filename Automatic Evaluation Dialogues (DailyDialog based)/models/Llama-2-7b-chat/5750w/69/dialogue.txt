Human 2:	I'm just an AI a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, I don't have personal preferences or like calling anyone Turkey
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	How can I help you today? </s>
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 Haha you got me there! I'm just an AI and do not have a physical body or home, so I did not cook
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Haha chicken is a great alternative! Thanksgiving with turkey is a classic, but you can always switch it up and try something new
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 you are funny. But anyways Thanksgiving games are always a lot of fun. Did you have any big turkey challange
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	that sounds like a lot of fun! office tennis is a great game for Thanksgiving 😂
