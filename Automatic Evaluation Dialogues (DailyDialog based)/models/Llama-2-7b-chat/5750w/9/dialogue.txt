Human 2:	 LED lights very festive and eco-friendly fake Christmas tree set up put holidays stay healthy relax better well definitely hear you
Human 1:	 Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.
Human 2:	Yes, that's a very eco-friendly and practical decision! Buying artificial tree can also save you the hassle of throwing
Human 1:	 Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.
Human 2:	I think that's a great point and more eco-friendly too! Now can we just set some Christmas lights with out not having these
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target has some good deals and the tree was very festive! I have 2 trees for decoration one real from childhood that smells
Human 1:	 Great, I hope you find a nice tree.
