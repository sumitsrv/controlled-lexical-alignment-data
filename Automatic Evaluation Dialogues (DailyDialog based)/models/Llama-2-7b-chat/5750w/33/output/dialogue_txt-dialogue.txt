A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] glad _you have_ [been] trained on [how to make croissants] ! [it's great] [to learn] new skills [but] [flakey] [croissants] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is a _good_ idea . _i'll_ _give_ it a _try_ next time . would [you] say [you have] a sweet tooth ?

B|11| Human 2: [i'll] [try] [to] [get away with] [that] [too] [! but] [croissants] [have] [the] right [flakey] texture , [don't] [they] ? [it's] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort of stuff _was_ _when_ _<redacted_term> was_ being _marketed_ as a fat substitute , [and] caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think] [they] [marketed] [that] [too] well . [<redacted_term> was] [good] [when] toasted [and] butter [was] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
