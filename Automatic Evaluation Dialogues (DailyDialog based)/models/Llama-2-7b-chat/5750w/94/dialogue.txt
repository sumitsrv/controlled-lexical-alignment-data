Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have lunch or hunger, but I'm here to help you with any questions
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't eat, but you can ask me for recommendations on what to eat in your area<|
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm glad you're considering vegetarian options! There are so many delicious and filling vegetarian meals you can try. Have you
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm glad you're open to considering vegetarian options for the environment and human suck 😜. buffet style place
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm glad you love them 😊 They are all pretty expensive though, Have you tried different vegetarian dishes or restaurants
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm glad you love it too 😊 peanut butter can have a strong taste depending on how it's prepared
