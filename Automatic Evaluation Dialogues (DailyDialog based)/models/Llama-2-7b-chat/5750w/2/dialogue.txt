Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	😃 Just doing my job! 🤖 How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	🤔 Let me check... last time was like... wow, that's a long time ago! 😅
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	🤔 But it's fun you get to catch up with an old friend like that! What do you say was the last time
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh wow! Sounds like you've been really busy! Has it been tough to balance your life recently?<|im_
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Ahh adventures 🌄 Sounds like you'd be fun to hangout with sometimes maybe we can grab coffee or something more
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	😅🐴 Ahh that sounds like fun but maybe you could try it for the really adventurous ��
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 Saturday you say? Hmmmm maybe I'll try that bull riding then 🤠 What do you think?<|
