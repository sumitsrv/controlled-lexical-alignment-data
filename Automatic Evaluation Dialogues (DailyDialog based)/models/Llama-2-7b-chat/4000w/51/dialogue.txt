Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's really interesting! 🐴 How do you like horse racing? Do you have a favorite horse or race? ��
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😂 It's great that you're having fun with friends! How long had it been since you last saw them? C
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're thinking about going fishing! It can be a great way to relax and enjoy nature.  How long had you
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going on a weekend getaway to the mountains. How about you? Have any fun plans? ���
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going there with some friends over the weekend  nice cooling down haha Have you any fun plans yourself?<
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'd like that too though Tokyo can be super overwhelming 😅 Have you been there before? What about the food
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	What about the food though haha  I've tried some Tokyo street food before and It was super good! Have you been there?
