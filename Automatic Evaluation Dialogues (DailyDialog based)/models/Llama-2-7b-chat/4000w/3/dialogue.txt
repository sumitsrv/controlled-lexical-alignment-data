Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I'm afraid I'm just an AI and do not have access to real-time weather information or current conditions at the location you are
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to like or dislike rain or any other weather condition<|im_end
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 rain's not that bad. It's the water trouble that's much worse... lots of flooding this year<|im_
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Haha that's interesting! Where do you live? 
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 okay interesting you say lol... but here water trouble make people talk too much this year... can't see the drought that was there
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
