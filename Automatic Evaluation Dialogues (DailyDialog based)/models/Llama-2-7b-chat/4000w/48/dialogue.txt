Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I was trained to have conversations that are enjoyable for the user, and I love shellfish!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?

Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I have not done this before
