A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can certainly help [you] _with_ your flower- 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory ._ why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] popular choice ! _it's_ [a] symbol _of_ beauty , purity _, and_ spiritual growth in many cultures 
A|6| Human 1: oh , [it's] _not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] _theory ._ [i] _think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ true , but [it's] an interesting [theory .] [people] [have] [preferences] for various reasons , such _as_ [personal] experiences 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's a_ bad thing ! [the gerbera] _is_ [a] cheerful [and] vibrant [flower] [that] can bring [a] lot 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ _someone_ what _their_ favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [people] [are] looking for [someone] _with the_ same [flower] [personality] [as] [their] own ! [it's] fascinating [that] [you] [think] [of] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk [with_ the] person some _more_ [, and] _ask_ _them_ some _more_ _questions_ [, and] gradually _develop_ [a] sense [of] what _they're_ [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two _to_ five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [more] they [ask] [you] [questions] [and] [the] [more] they [talk with] [them] [over] time , [the] better [they're] able [to] [develop] [their] [flower] [personality] . [it] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
