Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can certainly help you with your flower-
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	Ah, the lotus flower is indeed a popular choice! It's a symbol of beauty, purity, and spiritual growth in many cultures
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm not sure that's true, but it's an interesting theory. People have preferences for various reasons, such as personal experiences
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm not sure that's a bad thing! The gerbera is a cheerful and vibrant flower that can bring a lot
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 It's like people are looking for someone with the same flower personality as their own! It's fascinating that you think of
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	The more they ask you questions and the more they talk with them over time, the better they're able to develop their flower personality. It
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
