Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a good way to de-stress and challenge yourself physically. How was the climb?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	It's nice to have the weekend off! What movie are you watching  How was your day?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah nice! This movie was very good and the twists were great! What's your favorite part?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hahah nice! What's the movie about?  I can't wait to see it when I get out of work! How was
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	Hmm good question  I like winter too actually It was nice and not very dark out Hahah you'd look funny but that can see
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I've been too many winters can you see the southern lights from Australia
