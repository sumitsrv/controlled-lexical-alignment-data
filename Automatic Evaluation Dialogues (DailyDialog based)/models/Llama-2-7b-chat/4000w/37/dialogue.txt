Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I'm just an AI, so I don't have personal experiences like humans do,
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I think you should exercise with friends! It's more fun and motivating that way. Plus,
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	I'm getting some great recommendations for Switch games! I think you would love it. What about you? Do you play any games yourself?
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	I'm not much into gaming but it seems like something you would be interested in? What do you think about Switch game recommendations?<
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	I'm not much for dragons but it sounds like you enjoyed the book. What made it so good read?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI but you are the most recent good thing for me. What book would recommend to read?<|im_end
