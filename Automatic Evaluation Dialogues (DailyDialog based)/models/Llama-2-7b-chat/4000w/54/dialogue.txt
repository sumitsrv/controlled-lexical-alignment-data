Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! 😊 pingpong is a fun game. What do you think about artificial intelligence?<|
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	😂 I'm just an AI. It amazing that you won but still taking credit for it. AI is fasc
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I can play many game very well. What about you?
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or racquetball skills like you.  What game would you like
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, hitting ball with racquet is like  for you? Haha, cage match that is your game then
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	That's funny, I think it sounds like you and I just don't click when it comes t tennis  though! Haha<
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
