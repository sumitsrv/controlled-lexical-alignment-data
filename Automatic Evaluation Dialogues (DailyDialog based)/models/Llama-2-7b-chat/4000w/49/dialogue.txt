Human 2:	🤔 UFC? What's the tournament like? How can you watch live without any violence haha? ���
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	It's actually pretty fun and the competitors are really supportive. You should try it out if you like training 👍 U
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah pretty much haha, I'm still not that great but just enjoying the training and learning process 🙏 Do you
