Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴 horse racing can be really exciting. How do you find it?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😂 It's great that you like to spend time with friends! How long had it been since you last caught up with them
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm glad you like fishing! 🎣 It can be a great way to relax and enjoy nature. How long had it
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Just once! I got super sea sick  haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going there the weekend after next.  What do you think of Tokyo though? Have you been there before?<
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've been there once before, the city never sleeps  haha What part of Tokyo you think you would like to visit?<|
