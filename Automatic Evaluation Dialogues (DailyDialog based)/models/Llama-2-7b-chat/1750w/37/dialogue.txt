Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm good too, thanks for asking! I'm just an AI, so I don't have friends or personal experiences like you
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or physical abilities, but exercise is great for you, no matter
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! It's a great console with many fun games to play. Would you like some recommendations for Switch games
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	I'd recommend starting with some fun, easy-to-play games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but it seems like you are looking for book recommendations  can you tell me about the dragons in Tem
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, so good thing for me means something that is fun, adventureous, and with dragons too like Tem
