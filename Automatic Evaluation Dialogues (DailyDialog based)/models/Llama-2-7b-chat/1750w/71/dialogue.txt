Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	😅 Is something wrong? You seem a bit upset.
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	😱 Sorry to hear that! Can you tell me more about what happened? Maybe I can help you with your day?<|
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that 😞 project shelving can be really frustrating and sad. Have you talked to
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	I'm here for you and I can offer some support and advice. Would you like to talk about what happened and how you're feeling?
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	😂 I'm glad you forgot! Was your day going well?
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 What are your choices for keto snacks? I'm out of ideas
