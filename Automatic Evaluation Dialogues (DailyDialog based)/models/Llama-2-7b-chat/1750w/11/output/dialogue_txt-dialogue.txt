B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working _on_ _a_ _theory_ . why does _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] [flower] ! yes _, it's_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ [spring] _and_ rebirth in many cultures . [the lotus] _is_ often 
A|6| Human 1: oh [, _it's] not_ research _! just_ [a] [personal] _theory_ . _i think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ more revealing [of] _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ an interesting [theory] [! just] _as_ [people] [have] different [preferences] for music , food _, and_ hobbies [, it's] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon _and then_ _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [with] [you] there ! [the gerbera] _is_ definitely [not] [the] most refined or elegant [flower] out there , but [it] has [a] certain charm 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask someone_ what _their favourite flower_ [is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . does _that_ _make_ sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [just] [that] [it's not] [like] [you] can [ask someone] [their favourite flower] [and then] [make] definitive [personality] judgments based [on] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some more [, and] [ask] them some more questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two _to_ five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ [the] best way [to] go about [it] [. it's] important [to] remember [that] [people] [are] complex [and] multifac 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
