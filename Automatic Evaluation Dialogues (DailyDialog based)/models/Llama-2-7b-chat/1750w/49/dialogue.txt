Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have weekends or personal feelings, but I'm here to help you with any questions
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	I'm looking forward to the weekend too! Are you going to watch any sports or have any fun plans?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Haha are you going to watch the sharks game live?
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	UFC  live? can you tell me the schedule and watch the tournament haha
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm actually pretty competitive myself, haha. It can be tough but fun at the same time 😃<|
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I will try 😜 but like you and the UFC haha that's pretty cool you are actually competing. Yeah j
