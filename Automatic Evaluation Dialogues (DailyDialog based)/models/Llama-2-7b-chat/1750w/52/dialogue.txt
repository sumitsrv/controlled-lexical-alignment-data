Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	😍 That's great! microkitchen is definitely worth checking out. However, I'm afraid I can't satisfy
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	😊 Ah, jackets are definitely needed during the cold season! microkitchen does have some goodies that you might like.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	😊 Its good that the weather is cold for our skin, but its even better when we don't suffer extreme cold weather.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Yeah, its good that you don't get to suffer extreme cold weather 🙂
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😳 Nice! Best place to live except for the cold weather, that's right!
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 Sure! I'll get the goodies for you right away. Where would you like to meet up to get them?<|im_
