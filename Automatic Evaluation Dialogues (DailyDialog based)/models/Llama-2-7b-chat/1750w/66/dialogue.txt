Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or any personal experiences, so I can't run marathons
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have any physical events or sporting activities planned
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Spartan race sounds like a challenging and fun event! Are you planning to participate in any upcoming events?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 It's great that you have fun obstacles like monkey bars and high walls! Are there any events coming up that you're planning
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	It's for sure fun and challenging but not overly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's good about the training sessions for technique practice 1-2 months before and can sign up for next one which is in February in Mon
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
