Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	Sorry to hear that. Life can definitely be challenging at times. But many people find comfort in believing in miracles, as it gives
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	It's understandable to have doubts about miracles, especially when people you know are facing difficult circumstances. However, many people find hope
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	It's good to know what you believe in and values can help guide you in life. However, it's also important to be mindful
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	It's good you have a sense of humor about it! 
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	What did you grow up with? Not much as a child and didn't have electricity growing up.  It makes things easier to understand people
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 Lol! You're too good! ALL THEIR MONEY! By people who have the means and resources to help change things.
