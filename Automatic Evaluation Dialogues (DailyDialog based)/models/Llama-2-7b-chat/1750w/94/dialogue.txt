Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or senses, so I don't need to eat lunch
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	I did not eat lunch, and I cannot eat any physical food. I exist solely as a digital entity, so I don't have
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not eat or have preferences for food, though I can understand and respond to your lunch conversations
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that you and the environment are going through difficulties.  Lunch buffet sounds like a fun experience though! Is there
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have personal experiences or preferences for lunch buffets or dishes, though I can provide you
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have personal experiences or preferences for food. However, I can tell you that it is rainy
