Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I haven't heard of it, actually. What's it about? Does it have any awards or nominations?<|im_end
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	I had a great weekend, thanks for asking! I did a lot of reading and watched a few episodes of my favorite TV show. How about
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	😅 Yeah, it's so good! I love the way they did the animation and the storyline! What did you think
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	🤔 Well, I did enjoy Spider-Man and the X-Men when I was a kid, but I'm more into
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	😂 I can't blame you, Spiderman can be scary sometimes! But the Mandalorian is definitely
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	😂 Well, I think he has a certain charm to him! But I can see why you might not find him attractive.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki is the god of mischief and the adopted son of Odin from Norse mythology! He's definitely not someone you want
