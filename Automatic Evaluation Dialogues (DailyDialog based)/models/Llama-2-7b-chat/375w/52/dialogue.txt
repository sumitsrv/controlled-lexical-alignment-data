Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	I'm afraid I can't confirm that. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to access the microkitchen. Would you like
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Haha, that's funny! Yeah, jackets are always useful, especially in cold weather. But if you're looking for something
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	😅 Indeed! It's important to stay warm and cozy during cold weather. Maybe you could try some hot chocolate
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	🤔 Hmm...I'm not sure. Is it in the north?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😅 Yeah! New York is a great place, but the cold weather can be tough. Do you live in a warm place
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	🤔 Yeah, you're right. Let's go get our treats before they're gone! ���
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	The one in our floor is the last place to get the goodies 😅
