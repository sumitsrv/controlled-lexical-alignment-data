A|4| Human 1: [i] guess its _a_ jacket ! very much needed [that] _in _the_ cold_ 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: haha , that's funny ! yeah , jackets [are] always useful , especially [in] _cold weather_ . but if you're looking _for_ something 
A|6| Human 1: _sure_ hate _it_ ! limits _our_ ability [to] _go_ out even [for] _a_ walk ! its good [that] we don't _get_ [to] suffer extreme [cold weather] ! 
B|7| Human 2: 😅 indeed ! it's important [to] stay warm _and_ cozy during [cold weather] . maybe _you_ could try [some] hot chocolate 
A|8| Human 1: oh nice ! where did _you live_ _before_ ?
