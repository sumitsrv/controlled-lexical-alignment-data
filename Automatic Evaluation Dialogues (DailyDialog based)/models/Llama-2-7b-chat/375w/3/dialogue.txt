Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have real-time access to weather data, but I can tell you the current weather conditions
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy

Human 2:	too much water is also a problem... it's difficult to balance the amount of rain and water that's needed for different areas of the world
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	Haha, I can understand that. It's not the same for everyone. Some people enjoy rainy days, and it's good for
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Oh that's good to hear! 24 hours water supply is definitely important. It's great that you have that there<|im
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	Climate change is a very serious issue that affects the entire world. It's important for us to take action to reduce our carbon footprint
