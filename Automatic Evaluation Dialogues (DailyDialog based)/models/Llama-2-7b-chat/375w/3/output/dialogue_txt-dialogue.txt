A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: _is_ it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm _just_ an _ai_ , _i don't_ _have_ real-time access _to_ _weather_ data , _but_ _i can_ tell _you_ _the_ current _weather_ conditions 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ [the] _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] like them _too much_ . they make _days_ _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: [i] understand [that] [rain] [days] _can_ be [gloomy] , _but_ they're also important for [the] environment and agriculture . [rain] helps _to_ recharge [the] _water_ 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ [water] trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: [too much] [water] [is] also _a_ problem ... it's difficult _to_ balance [the] amount [of] [rain] and [water] that's needed for different areas [of] [the] world 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ ... [i don't] think [i can] survive in [that] [weather] ever . [just] [the] rains at 50 degrees make me want [to] sit in heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: [haha] , [i can] understand [that] . it's not [the] same for everyone . some _people_ enjoy rainy [days] , and it's good for 
A|10| Human 1: [people] say there [is] drought here ... [but] we [have] _24 hours water supply_ here ... lol ... never seen [that] in [a] drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: oh that's good [to] hear ! [24 hours water supply] [is] definitely important . it's great [that] _you_ [have] [that] there<|im 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn interesting . did [you] see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [is] [a] very serious issue [that] affects [the] entire world . it's important for us [to] take action [to] reduce our carbon footprint 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking about how [ai] [is] helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
