B|9| Human 2: [the] [thing] you're talking [about] _is_ called functional magnetic resonance [imaging] (fmri) . [it] uses magnetic fields [and] radio waves [to] measure changes 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe in _science_ _! _science_ is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] pursuit of understanding [and] explanations [for] natural phenomena through observation , experimentation , [and] evidence-based reasoning . it's [not] 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad at [science] . [what] _can_ [science] [do] ? [is] [it] [the] most important [thing] [for] society ?
