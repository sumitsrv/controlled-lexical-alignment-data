A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once _or_ twice so far [, but] _they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why _. what_ _kind _of_ cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] _a_ variety [of cookies] [, but] my favorite _is_ peanut butter [cookies] . [they] _have a_ [great] texture _and_ flavor [. what] 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ thought , thanks !
