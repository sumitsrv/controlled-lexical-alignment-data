A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , _how are you_ 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ am good . [how are you] ? ：） 
B|3| Human 2: 😊 great _to_ hear ! is there _anything_ [you] would like _to_ chat about _or_ ask me ? i'm here _to_ help � 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ am busy . _a_ lot _of_ _work_ . what [are you] working on ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [i] see 😊 i'm just an ai , so [i] don't have any [work] like [you] _do_ , but 
A|6| Human 1: [i] am working on _a_ _new_ classifier . 
B|7| Human 2: it's [a] machine learning algorithm that can be used _to_ classify [new] data 🤖 
A|8| Human 1: [a] [new] classifier for hate speech . which _research_ _topic_ catches your eyes _most_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: that's an interesting [topic] 🤔 i'm [most] interested in natural language processing [research] right now 
A|10| Human 1: nice ! [do] [you] _refer to work_ [or] [anything] else ? 
B|11| Human 2: well , [i] [refer to work] in the context [of] machine learning and natural language processing 📚 
A|12| Human 1: [you] [are] very cool too !!
