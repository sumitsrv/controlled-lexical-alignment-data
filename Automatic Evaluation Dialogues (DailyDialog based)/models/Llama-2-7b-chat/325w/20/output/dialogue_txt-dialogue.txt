A|0| Human 1: hello , nice _to_ meet _you_ 
B|1| Human 2: if [you] could eat only _one_ _food_ for _the_ rest _of_ time , _what_ _would_ _it_ _be_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: hmm ... _that's a_ tough [one] . _i think_ _i would_ go asian [food] > chinese [food] > _stirfry_ . [what] _about_ [you] ? 
B|3| Human 2: [that's a] great choice ! [stirfry] _is_ [a] _very_ tasty _and_ versatile option . if [you] could switch lives _with_ _any_ person 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ _love_ _ice cream_ _too_ ! 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [ice cream] _is_ definitely [a] popular choice . if [you] could switch lives _with_ _any_ person , [would] [you] choose someone famous or someone ordinary ? < 
A|6| Human 1: _i_ _like_ vanilla more than chocolate [ice cream] . _i_ typically will _do_ [any] variations on vanilla . _to_ pick from [the] top _of my_ head , _i would_ say _cookies and cream_ , mint chocolate chip , [and] coffee . how _about_ [you] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [that's] great ! [cookies and cream] _is_ [one] [of my] favorites [too] . [and] [you] know who [i would] [love] [to] switch lives _with_ ? 
A|8| Human 1: [very] nice . [i] [love] sorbet's [and] smoothies . changing topics , _do you_ _believe in_ _an afterlife_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: interesting questions ! [i] [believe in] [the] possibility [of] [an afterlife] , but [i think] it's _something_ that _we_ can never truly know for sure . 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] so . [i] feel there must [be] [something] more than [the] physical _world_ as [we] understand [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: certainly . [do you] [think] there's anything [we] can [do] [to] help [the] [world] [and] make [it] [a] better place ? <|im_end 
A|12| Human 1: [what] [is] [the] most supernatural experience _you have_ ever _had_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: </s>sounds [like] [you have] [had] some amazing experiences ! it's interesting [to] [think] [about] [the] possibility [of] [an afterlife] [and] [what] [it] might 
A|14| Human 1: haha .. [that's a] cool experience . [i] went [to] [a] hindu retreat before , [a] number [of] buddhist temples , [and] hung out [with] christian mystics [in] santa cruz before .
