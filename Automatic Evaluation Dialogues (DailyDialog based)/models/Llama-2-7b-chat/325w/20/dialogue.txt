Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a great choice! Stirfry is a very tasty and versatile option. If you could switch lives with any person
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	Ah, ice cream is definitely a popular choice. If you could switch lives with any person, would you choose someone famous or someone ordinary?<
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	That's great! Cookies and Cream is one of my favorites too. And you know who I would love to switch lives with?
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	Interesting questions! I believe in the possibility of an afterlife, but I think it's something that we can never truly know for sure.
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	Certainly. Do you think there's anything we can do to help the world and make it a better place?<|im_end
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	</s>sounds like you have had some amazing experiences! It's interesting to think about the possibility of an afterlife and what it might
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
