Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	It's great that you have a variety of events to choose from. Doing obstacle races can be challenging but also very rewarding.
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	That sounds like a great challenge! Are you thinking of signing up for the Spartan race in February?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's good to work on technique and have a training plan in place, but you also need to make sure you're in good physical shape
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
