Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	Oh, that's exciting! Are you ready for the jump?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Ah, Seville is a great city. Have you tried any of the local cuisine?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Would you like to chat about skydiving or something else?<|im_
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you that skydiving is an incredible ad
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you that skydiving is an incredible advent
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Haha that's awesome! I'm sure you were very determined and focused to make it down the slope. I'm just an A
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
