Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	I'm good, thank you for asking! It's great to hear that you're feeling grateful. 😊 How can
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	🤔 I have a few plans for the weekend, but nothing too exciting. Just some work and relaxation at home.
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 It's really nice here this time of year, but cold! 🥶 What are you thankful for this Thanksgiving
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	🤔 Cool! Kingyo has some good Japanese food, huh? Perhaps one day you could take me there for a visit
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	No, I don't know anyone in the area. It was really nice of you to offer though! Perhaps some other time? ��
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 attend some conferences for work, but this one was really nice. They had good talks and it's always nice to meet people in
