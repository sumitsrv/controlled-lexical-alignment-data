Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a morning or a physical body, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	I'm here to assist you through your day, no matter what you have going on.
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're excited for work! Is there anything in particular that you're looking forward to today?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with information on acupunct
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	I understand your scepticism, but acupuncture has a long history and has been extensively studied in the scientific literature. The World
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	Lol. Yeah, comics always have the best lines. Keep going!
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
