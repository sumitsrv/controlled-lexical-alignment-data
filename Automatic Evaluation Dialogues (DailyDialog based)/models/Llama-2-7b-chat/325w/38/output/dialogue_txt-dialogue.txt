B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ _think_ about human like chat _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ _they are_ interesting _and_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ greatly improve customer service _and_ make tasks easier for people . _here_ _are_ _some of_ _the_ reasons why: 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] [have] _made_ [some] great _progress_ over last few years . _do_ _you_ _think the positives_ _outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: yes , _i [think_ the positives] [do] [outweigh the negatives] . _here_ _are_ _some of_ [the] reasons why: 
A|6| Human 1: like impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _haha ,_ yes , impersonation _is_ certainly _a_ concern . but there _are_ ways [to] address [it] , such _as_ using _ai_ [bots] _that_ [have] 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ [that] ! [some of] these [bots] [are] very engaging [and] _funny_ . [they are] now _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder how far [are] we from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :)

[it] will signify how _ai research has_ progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] like stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be_ overselling [it] [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: _haha ,_ [you] [might be] right ! but in all seriousness , [the] [progress] we're making in [ai] [and] nlp [research has] [the] potential
