A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ _favourite flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: sure ! _i_ _like_ daisies 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on _a_ _theory_ . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _that's a_ great question ! [the lotus] [flower] has [a] lot _of_ symbolism in many cultures . _it_ represents spiritual growth , transformation _, and_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! _just_ [a] personal _theory_ . _i _think_ that_ [flower] preferences are _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: _that's_ an interesting [theory] ! [i think] [you] might be onto something there . can [you] tell me [more] about _it_ ? <|im_end 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with a_ crayon [and] then [it] came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] carnation _is_ [like] [the] [flower] equivalent [of] [a] 40-year-old man [with a] beer belly [and] [a] mustache . 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their favourite flower_ [is] . pretty much [like] what we _just_ did . does _that_ _make_ sense _so_ far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] _they're_ trying [to] [make] [you] [think that] [their] [flower] represents something [more] [than] [just] [the] fact [that] they [like] [it] . _like ,_ 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] _the person_ some [more] [, and] ask them some [more] questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what [they're] [like ,] over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i] see . [so] you're saying [that] [the person] might be [more] [than] [just] [their [favourite flower] ?] [like] they [have a] [personality] [and] all [that] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
