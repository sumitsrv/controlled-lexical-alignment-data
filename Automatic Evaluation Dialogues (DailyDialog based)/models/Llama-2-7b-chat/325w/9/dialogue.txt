Human 2:	I completely agree with you! It's important to be eco-friendly and responsible these days, especially during the holiday season. Christmas
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target does have a good selection of Christmas decorations and trees! 🎄 Have you ever tried the Christmas lights that change colors? They
