A|4| Human 1: _glad_ [to] hear you're better . sorry [to] hear _you_ were _sick_ . [i] was _sick_ _a_ couple _of_ weeks ago _with a_ bad cough . _there's_ _definitely_ _a_ bug [going] around . admit [i] [just] want _to stay healthy_ _for the holidays_ [and] plan [to] _relax_ . 
B|5| Human 2: _i'm_ [just] _an_ ai _, i_ don't get [sick] _, but_ [i] understand [the] desire [to stay healthy] during [the holidays] . 
A|6| Human 1: _definitely_ ! [i] know _a_ lot _of_ folks _travel_ _for the holidays_ [, but] _i'm happy [to_ stay] home myself ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm happy to] help [you] [with] anything [you] need _for the holidays !_ _do_ [you] _have_ any [travel] plans or shopping _to do_ ? < 
A|8| Human 1: me too . now [i have] folks come visit me [for the holidays !] [but] that's also tiresome ..

A|10| Human 1: yes ! we set up [an] _eco-friendly_ (i . e . fake) _christmas_ _tree_ [and] _put_ up some colorful led _lights_ which is _very_ festive . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] sure _that_ would be [very] relaxing [and] enjoyable [for] [you] ! [christmas] [lights] _can_ [definitely] [put] people _in the_ holiday spirit . _do_ [you] 
A|12| Human 1: buying [a] _tree_ is [a] neat experience . [i] was torn between buying [an] artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one [that] smells _like_ _fresh_ pine . [in the] end , we opted [for the] one [that] we [can] disassemble every year . 
B|13| Human 2: 🤖 [i'm] [glad] [you] [like] [the] [tree] ! 🎄 [there's] nothing [like] [the] smell [of] [fresh] p 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , [very] clever pun ! [i] [like] [it] ! depends . [i] remember having real [christmas] _trees_ [from] childhood [, but] _these days_ [with] climate _change_ [, i] think not chopping down [a] [tree] [just] [to] decorate [it] [and] then throw [it] out [in] [a] month is [the] more _responsible_ thing [to do] . 
B|15| Human 2: [i] completely agree [with] [you] ! it's important [to] be [eco-friendly] [and] [responsible] [these days] , especially during [the] holiday season . [christmas] 
A|16| Human 1: admit my favorite store is _target_ , plus _they_ often [have] [good] deals .

A|18| Human 1: great [, i] hope [you] find [a] nice [tree] .
