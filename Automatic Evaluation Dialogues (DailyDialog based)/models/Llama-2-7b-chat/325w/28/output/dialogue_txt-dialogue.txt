B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks _. i_ just ate _a_ delicious _breakfast_ , which always sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that_ ! [breakfast] _is_ an important meal _to_ kickstart [the day] . _is_ there anything else [i] can help _you_ with 
A|4| Human 1: [i] had _eggs and hash browns_ . way less healthier than _your_ apple , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: (chuckles) [i] see . well , [eggs and hash browns] _are_ [a] [great] [breakfast] choice as well . they're both high _in_ protein 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's true_ . if [you] _could_ only _eat_ _one_ _food_ _forever_ , _what_ _would_ _it_ be ? 
B|7| Human 2: [that's] [a] tough [one] ! _i think_ [i] [would] _have_ _to say_ pizza [. i] [could] [eat] _that_ [forever] [and] never get tired _of_ _it ._ 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange [would] be [a] drawback ! [that] turns my mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly want [to say] _soylent_ or [one] [of] those other "complete foods" , which [i think] defeats [the] purpose [of] [the] question . [i'm] [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [soylent] _is_ [a] [great] choice ! [i think] [the] idea [of] [a] complete [food] [that] provides everything [you] need _is_ really interesting . but [i'm] not 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant [. i] love [it .] 
B|11| Human 2: [soylent] _is_ [great] [and] [i think] it's [the] future _of food_ ! but [what] about [you] , chuckles ? what's [your] take 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . [what] sort [of food] do [you] _feel_ like ? 
B|13| Human 2: [that's true] ! [i think] [the] best _food is_ [one] [that] [you] enjoy [and] [feel] good 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
