Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! Breakfast is an important meal to kickstart the day. Is there anything else I can help you with
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	(chuckles) I see. Well, eggs and hash browns are a great breakfast choice as well. They're both high in protein
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	That's a tough one! I think I would have to say pizza. I could eat that forever and never get tired of it.
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	Soylent is a great choice! I think the idea of a complete food that provides everything you need is really interesting. But I'm not
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	Soylent is great and I think it's the future of food! But what about you, Chuckles? What's your take
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	That's true! I think the best food is one that you enjoy and feel good
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
