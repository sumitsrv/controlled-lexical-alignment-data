Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell. 🤒 Is there anything I can do to help? <|
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm sorry you had to stop the travelling this year 😢. Have you been able to enjoy some good books or mov
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I have big plans for relaxing 😴 It'll be a lot of lounging on the couch binge-
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Ah I see 😅 It's always good to have a relaxing place to go to when you're feeling under the weather
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I can imagine! It's always good to have some lotion handy when you're going to be outside for
