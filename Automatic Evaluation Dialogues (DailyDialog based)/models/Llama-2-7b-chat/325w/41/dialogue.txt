Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	That's too bad. Sometimes, we all need a little bit of hope and positivity in our lives. 
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.

Human 2:	It's okay. Not everyone has the same experiences, and empathy can be difficult to cultivate. I grew up in a small town
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	Lol, no not by a person or organisation. More like the lack of resources and opportunities in general. It can be hard to get by
