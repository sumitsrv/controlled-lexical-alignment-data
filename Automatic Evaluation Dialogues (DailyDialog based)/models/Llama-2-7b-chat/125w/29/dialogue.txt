Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thanks for asking! I'm just an AI, I don't have feelings or emotions like humans do
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a career or work part-time 😊<|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	I'm glad you take classes that make you happy! Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work 🤔<
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	That's awesome! I'm more of a coffee drinker myself, but I love the idea of making tea ware ���
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	Oh wow, you're a true artist! 💖 I'm just a simple chatbot, but I love making tea
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Yes, I've heard those are very delicate and nuanced 😊 What's your favorite tea-related hobby
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	That sounds great! I love learning about different teas and their unique flavors 🤔 What's your favorite tea-related memory
