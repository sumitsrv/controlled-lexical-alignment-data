Human 2:	Yes, I am! How about you?
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	I agree! Mentorship can be a great way to learn and grow as a developer. It's always good to have someone to guide
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	That's great! Having a good mentor can make a big difference in your learning experience. Do you have any specific goals or areas of interest
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	yeah, I think so too. It's good to have a mix of 1:1 mentorship and peer-to-peer
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	things like programming languages, frameworks, and tools, but also soft skills like communication and teamwork
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	awesome! Communication skills are definitely important, especially in a remote work environment
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
