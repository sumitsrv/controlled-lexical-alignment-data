Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help you understand the concepts. Can you please provide me with some information about the topics you're struggling
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	Actually, I'm not able to have a direct conversation right now. However, you can find the recording of last week's lectures
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	I have already started preparing for the test. I have been going through past exams and notes. Do you have any tips on how to help
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 Of course! I'm here to help. But I think that the syllabus may not be as tough as you think,
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	I'm glad you find the content interesting. What do you think of the course structure? Do you think it's well-organized?
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	Thanks for the encouragement! Do you think you'll be able to help me study next week? We could go over some practice questions together<
