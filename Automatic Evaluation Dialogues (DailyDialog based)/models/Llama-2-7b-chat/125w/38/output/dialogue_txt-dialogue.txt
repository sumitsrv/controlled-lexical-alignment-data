A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're _pretty_ cool ! _they_ _can_ help [you] _with_ _a_ lot _of_ tasks _and_ answer questions for [you] . 🤖 [what] [about] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ _some_ _great_ _progress_ over last few years . do [you] _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: 🤔 _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] , but it's important [to] consider both sides . _on_ one hand 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ _impersorsination_ ? though it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _haha ,_ yeah [impersorsination] _is_ _a_ possibility 😅 . but seriously , there _are_ [some] potential downsides [to] human- 
A|8| Human 1: true that _! some of_ these bots [are] _very_ engaging [and] funny . _they are_ now good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far [are] we _from_ [the] time these bots start _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: 🤔 [they are] _already_ [giving monologues] [! some of] them [have] [very] advanced language processing capabilities [and] _can_ engage in _conversation_ [like] _a_ 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! it will signify how _ai research_ has progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on] [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be_ overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 😅 _haha ,_ [you] [might be] right ! but in all seriousness , [the] [progress] being [made] in [ai research] [is] truly remarkable [and] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions [already] do [pretty] good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: 🤖 [i [think] the] possibilities [are] endless ! [from] [more] advanced chatbots , [to] personalized virtual assistants , [to] [even] creating 
A|14| Human 1: [haha ,] [pretty] far fetched 🙂 nice having this [conversation] [with] _you !_ 
B|15| Human 2: 😊 [the] same [to] [you !] it's been [a] [great] [conversation] [and] it's always fascinating [to] discuss [the] potential [of] [a]
