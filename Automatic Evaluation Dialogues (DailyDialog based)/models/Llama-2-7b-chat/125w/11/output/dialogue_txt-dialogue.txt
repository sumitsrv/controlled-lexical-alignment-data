A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working _on_ _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] very symbolic _and_ culturally significant [flower] in many societies . [the lotus] _is_ often associated _with_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! [just] [a] [personal] theory . _i think_ _that_ _flower preferences_ _are_ more revealing [of] _personality_ than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] see . well , [lotus] flowers [are] known for _their_ beauty _and_ symbolism in many cultures . they [are] often associated _with_ spirituality , growth 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _gerbera_ . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then it came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] _that's a_ common association ! [gerbera] flowers [are] known for _their_ bright colors [and] cheerful appearance , which can definitely _make_ _them_ seem 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ what [their] favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . does _that_ [make] _sense_ _so_ far ? 
B|11| Human 2: yes , [that] makes [sense] ! [so] , you're saying [that] people's [flower preferences] can reveal [their] [personality] traits [and] interests ? 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some more , [and] ask [them] some more questions , [and] _gradually_ _develop a_ [sense] [of] what they're _like_ , over [the] course [of] maybe two _to_ five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and] _that's_ how [you] can [develop a] [personality] profile for [someone] based [on] [their] [flower preferences] ! [it's like] getting [to] know [them] [gradually] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
