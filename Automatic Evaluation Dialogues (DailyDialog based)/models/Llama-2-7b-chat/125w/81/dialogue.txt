Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	Oh cool! How was it? Did you have fun?
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	Haha that sounds like it was a wild ride! Are you a beginner skier?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	Oh, I see! Well, I'm just an AI, I don't know any languages in the way that a human would.
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Did you take any cool pictures or videos while you were there?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can certainly help you plan a trip to the Olympics! Do
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to pull myself along the sides.
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide information, not to <REDACTED_TERM> anything.
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
