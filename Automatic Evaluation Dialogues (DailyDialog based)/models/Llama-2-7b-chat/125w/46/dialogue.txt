Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help. Please describe the scenario you're thinking of.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	Ah, I see. Taking sides can be a difficult situation, especially when it's a matter of personal loyalty. Have you talked to
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I understand why you might feel that way. When it comes to friendships, it's important to prioritize the ones that are truly important
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	Haha, well, I'm not sure that's the best approach. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with all
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not always easy, but it's important to find your own balance that works for you. It might take some experimentation and reflection
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm just kidding. It's important to find a balance that works for you, but it's also important to be present
