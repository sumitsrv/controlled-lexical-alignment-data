Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Oh, wow! That sounds like a lot of fun! I'll have to check with the kids and see if they're interested
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That sounds great! I'll definitely let the kids know and we can discuss their schedule. Can you please send me the details of the trip
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	😉 Yes, that's true. Traffic can get pretty bad around the holidays. But it will be worth it
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Great, that would work perfectly! I'll make sure to find an Airbnb close to the Disney resort so you can all enjoy the events
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point. I will double-check the holiday hours for the Airbnb and surrounding areas. Thank you for bringing that up!<|
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	🎀That's a great question! I'm getting <REDACTED_TERM> for them this year.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Ah, perfect! We can def play with legos together. Do you have any <REDACTED_TERM> for the <RE
