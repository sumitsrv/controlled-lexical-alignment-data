Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	Yes, I've been training regularly and have seen some improvements in my pace.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm not sure yet, but I'd like to compete in a few races this summer if possible.
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Do you do any other types of exercise besides running?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Oh, cool. Yeah, obstacle courses can be fun and challenging. They require a lot of strength, endurance, and agility.
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	February? Hmm, that's soon. I'll have to see if I can make it happen. Thanks for letting me know!<|
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Will do! It's good to have a training ground to practice on. Thanks for letting me know!
