Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	Whoa, that's quite an adventure! Did you enjoy it?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Yeah, I've heard of it. It's definitely a thrilling experience. Did you feel scared at all?<|
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not really into thrill rides, but I do enjoy a good challenge. It's great to see people pushing themselves to try
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 Yeah, it's definitely reassuring when you know the safety measures are in place. Did you take any pictures or videos during the ride
