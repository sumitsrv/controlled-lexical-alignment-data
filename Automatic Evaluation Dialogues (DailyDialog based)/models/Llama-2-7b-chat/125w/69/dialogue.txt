Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have access to personal information or memories, so I cannot confirm or deny any party events.
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or feelings, so I cannot have a party or eat turkey. Additionally
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Is there anything else you would like to chat about?
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	🙂</s>sounds like you had a fun time! did you cook the turkey at home or get it from outside?<
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	got it! Thanksgiving with chicken is definitely a good alternative 🍗 What are some of your favorite chicken dishes?
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	oh cool! What games did you play? I'm always looking for new game ideas 🎮
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	that sounds like a lot of fun! Pictionary is always a classic 🎨 Did you have any challenges or issues during the party
