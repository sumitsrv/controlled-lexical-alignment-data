Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a great choice! Stirfry is a classic. If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?<
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	Yes! Ice cream is delicious. If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be? <<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Cookies and Cream is a great choice! If you could switch lives with any celebrity for a day, who would it be?<|
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	Oh, wow that's a really tough question. I think so. I believe that when we pass away, our souls will continue
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	That's an interesting perspective. Do you think there could be any possibility of reincarnation or a continuation of existence in some form after
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	That's a great question. I have had some unusual experiences, but they
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
