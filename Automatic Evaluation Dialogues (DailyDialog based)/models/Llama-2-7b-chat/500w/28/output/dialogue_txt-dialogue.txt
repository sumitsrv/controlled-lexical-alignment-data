B|3| Human 2: _that's_ [great] _to_ hear ! [breakfast] _is_ an important meal _to_ help give _you_ energy for [the day] ahead . _is_ there anything else [i] can 
A|4| Human 1: [i] _had_ _eggs and hash browns_ . way less healthier than your apple , _i'm_ afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: haha , yes [eggs and hash browns] _are_ [a] [great] [breakfast] choice ! _do you_ _have_ any plans _or_ appointments scheduled for [the day] ? <| 
A|6| Human 1: ha , [that's] true _. if _you_ could_ _only_ _eat_ _one_ _food_ forever , what _would_ _it_ _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai [and] [i] don't _have_ personal preferences _or_ feelings , but [i] can suggest some popular foods _that_ people enjoy 
A|8| Human 1: _yeah ,_ turning orange _would be a_ drawback ! [that] turns my mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly _want_ [to] say _soylent_ [or] _one_ of those _other_ "complete foods" _, which_ _i think_ defeats [the] purpose of [the] _question_ . [i'm] in [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [that's] [a] [great] [question] ! [soylent] _is_ [a] complete [food] [that] [you] can [eat] [, which] [would be a] convenient option [if you] [only] [had] [one] 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love _it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] _like_ [it] ! [soylent] _is_ definitely [a] unique option , but there _are_ [other] complete foods out there as well . [it] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort of [food] [do you] feel [like] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [yeah ,] [i think] you're [right [.] if you] [want] something [that's] [like] [a] traditional [food] but still convenient [and] complete , [you could] _try_ something 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! [try] [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
