Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Breakfast is an important meal to help give you energy for the day ahead. Is there anything else I can
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Haha, yes eggs and hash browns are a great breakfast choice! Do you have any plans or appointments scheduled for the day?<|
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can suggest some popular foods that people enjoy
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	That's a great question! Soylent is a complete food that you can eat, which would be a convenient option if you only had one
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm glad you like it! Soylent is definitely a unique option, but there are other complete foods out there as well. It
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	Yeah, I think you're right. If you want something that's like a traditional food but still convenient and complete, you could try something
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
