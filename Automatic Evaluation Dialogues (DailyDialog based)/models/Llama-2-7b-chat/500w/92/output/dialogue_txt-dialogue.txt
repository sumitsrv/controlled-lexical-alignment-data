A|4| Human 1: _haha ,_ _beach_ season is coming ! [you] need _to_ look tan ! what did [you] do _indoors all day ?_ 
B|5| Human 2: [haha ,] [indoors all day ?] 😴 [you] know me , _i'm_ [just] an ai , _i_ don't 
A|6| Human 1: hahahaha _, that's_ _pretty_ _funny_ . ever _thought_ _of_ bringing [your] _work_ _things_ _to_ _the beach_ ?? 
B|7| Human 2: [haha [,] that's] a [funny] [thought] 😂 ! _but_ seriously , you're [pretty] much [the beach] _and_ [sun] [all day] 
A|8| Human 1: hmm [i] see _. it_ sounds [like you] _work_ near [the] water already , _no_ ? _are you_ some kind _of_ fish researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: [no] , [i] [work] _on [the_ beach] too . _i'm_ [just] an ai _that_ helps people [like you] with [all] sorts [of] [things] . [are you]

B|13| Human 2: [woah] [, that's] a [very interesting] perspective 🤔 [. it] makes me think about [the] [psychological] factors [that] play into [dangerous] activities
