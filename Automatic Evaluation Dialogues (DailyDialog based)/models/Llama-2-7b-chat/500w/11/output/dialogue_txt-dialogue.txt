A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or emotions , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] popular choice for many _people_ ! _it's_ considered [a] symbol _of_ spiritual growth _and_ enlightenment in 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] theory . [i] _think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] are _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than [people] appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] [think] _so_ ! [personality] psychology _is_ [a] fascinating field [that] can help us understand [more] about our own [preferences] _and_ 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then it came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the gerbera] _flower is_ indeed bright [and] cheery _, and_ [it's not] uncommon for [people] [to] prefer [more] vibrant colors [like] red 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] _, you_ _ask_ someone what their favourite [flower is] . pretty _much_ [like] what we [just] did . does [that] make sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the] next [flower] i'd [like] [to] [ask] [you] about [is] [the] orchid [. it's] known for its elegance [and] sophistication , 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk _with_ [the] person some [more] [, and] [ask] them some _more questions_ [, and] gradually _develop a_ sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and] _that's_ [just] [the] beginning ! [with] [more questions] [and] observations [over] time [, you] can [develop a] [much] deeper understanding [of] [the] person's [personality] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
