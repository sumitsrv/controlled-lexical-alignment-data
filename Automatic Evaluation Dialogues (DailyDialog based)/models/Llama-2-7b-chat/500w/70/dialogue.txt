Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	Nice! Playing guitar and producing music can be really rewarding. What kind of music do you play? Do you have any favorite artists or gen
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	Yeah, chords can be tricky! It's important to practice them regularly to build up your finger strength and dexterity. Have you tried
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	That's true! Once you know the chords, you can play many different songs and write your own music. It's like building blocks
