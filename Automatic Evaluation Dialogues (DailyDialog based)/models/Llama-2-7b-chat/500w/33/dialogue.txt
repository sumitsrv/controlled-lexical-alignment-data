Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants! They're one of my favorite pastries. What's your favorite filling?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?

Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!

Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so!  Would you like to try some lemon poppyseed cookies next?

Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or eat pastries, but I'm here to help with any
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have personal experiences or stomach upsets to report! But I'd be happy to
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
