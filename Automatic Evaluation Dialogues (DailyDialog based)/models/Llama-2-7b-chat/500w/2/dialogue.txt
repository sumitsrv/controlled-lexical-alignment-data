Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	Great! 😊 Is there anything you'd like to chat about or ask? I'm here to help! ��
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	🤔 Hmm, let me see... *counting* Yeah, I think it was last weekend when we had a fun time
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	😅 But it's great you guys had a fun time together! Do you do stuff like that often?<|im_
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Yeah, maybe you could tell me more about it sometime 😊
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Oh, I see 🙂 maybe you could plan a spontaneous adventure with your friends sometimes?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	Oh wow, that sounds really fun! I've never tried it before but I'm up for an adventure 😃
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Ah, that sounds like fun! 😊 Maybe we could plan a trip to the beach? What do you think?<|im
