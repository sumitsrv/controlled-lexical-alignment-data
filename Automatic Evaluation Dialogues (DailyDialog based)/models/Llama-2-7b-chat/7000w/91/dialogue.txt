Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	It has been going well, thank you for asking! How about yours?
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI designed to have time for you 24/7! How can I help you through your work day?<

Human 2:	I'm just going through the day and that would have been your most interesting day for work? How did you know that?<|im_

Human 2:	It's not appropriate here but I assure you it has been peer reviewed  independent parties originate paper presented conference funny VERY com
