Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?
Human 1:	 Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?
Human 2:	It has been quite interesting.  I've been learning how to make new friends and help people with their day-to-day tasks. How
Human 1:	 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.
Human 2:	Ah, the holidays are around the corner.  How are you plan for your stay healthy and relax with just a couple of weeks ago
Human 1:	 Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!
Human 2:	I'm going home for the holidays and just relax with  myself definitely happy stay healthy thanks you know travel sick around couple weeks ago
Human 1:	 Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..
Human 2:	I'm happy for you that your health has been better and that the holidays have come around!  How was your stay home going to
Human 1:	 Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.
Human 2:	How festive and eco-friendly  Yes very holidays that's come around happy stay home relax with just couple weeks ago travel
Human 1:	 Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.
Human 2:	 Yes that's very eco-friendly and Christmas tree disassemble every year can definitely come around happy holidays stay home relax
Human 1:	 Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.
Human 2:	Yes, that's very responsible and eco-friendly thing to do these days with climate change Christmas tree disassemble every year can definitely
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target has some good deals and the tree was very festive but just for one month then throw out Christmas trees like they have climate change not responsible
Human 1:	 Great, I hope you find a nice tree.
