Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants! They're such a great treat to make. What's been the most challenging part for you?<|
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I've made them all! 😄 But croissants are great, you have to make sure they have enough butter fla
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm sure you have good butt
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	It's great that you have good butter to give them flakey texture. What kind of sweet treats do you make next time I try
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	But don't you think that could get the pastries all too sweet to eat them? I have made croissants with butter  fla
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm trying to think of the last time I made pastries that have but <REDACTED_TERM> and flave with
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
