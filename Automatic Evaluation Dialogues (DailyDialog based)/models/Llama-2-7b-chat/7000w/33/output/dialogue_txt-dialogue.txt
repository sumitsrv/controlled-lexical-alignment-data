A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once or twice so far , _but_ _they_ haven't [been] _flakey_ _enough_ . _i'm trying to_ figure out why _. what kind of_ cookies _have_ [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] [them] _all_ ! 😄 [but] [croissants] are [great ,] _you have_ [to make] sure [they] [have] [enough] butter fla 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] sure _you have_ [good] butt

B|11| Human 2: [but] [don't] [you] [think] [that] [could get] [the] [pastries all] [too] [sweet] [to] [eat] [them] ? [i] [have] [made] [croissants] [with] butter fla 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time i_ paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm trying to] [think] [of] [the last time i] [made] [pastries] [that] [have] [but] [<redacted_term>] [and] flave [with] 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
