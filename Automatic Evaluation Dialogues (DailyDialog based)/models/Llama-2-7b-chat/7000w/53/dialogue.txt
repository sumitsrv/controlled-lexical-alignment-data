Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 that's cool have you run any marathons before haha I just started
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	🏃‍♀️ one half-marathon every month cool that's like running long distances haha have you run any fun
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 Two days ago was the tough one for this month's half-marathon. I have run faster before, but that was the most
