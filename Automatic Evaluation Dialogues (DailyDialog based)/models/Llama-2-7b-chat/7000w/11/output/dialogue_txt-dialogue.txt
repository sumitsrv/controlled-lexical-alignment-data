A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory . why_ does _the lotus_ spring _to_ _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ purity , beauty _and_ spiritual growth in many cultures . in hinduism , [the lotus] _is_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, it's_ _not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] _theory ._ [i] _think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are more revealing of_ _personality_ _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ true , but [it's] an interesting [theory . why] [do you] [think] [people] [are more revealing of] _their_ [personal] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with a_ crayon _and then_ it came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: ah , [i] see . [the gerbera] _flower is_ often associated [with] happiness [and] joy [, [it's] like] [you] [are] radiating [that] vibe when 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ someone _what their favourite flower is_ . pretty _much_ [like] _what_ we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower is] [the] [favourite] [of] [people] [with a] [more] spiritual [and] introspective [personality] [. it's like] [their] [mind] [is] [much] deeper [than] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some more_ , [and] _ask them_ _some more questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] _what_ they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two _to_ five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and then] [you] [just] [have] [to] [ask them] [what their favourite flower is] [and] [it's like] [the] ultimate [personality] revealer [some more questions] 
A|14| Human 1: [why] thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
