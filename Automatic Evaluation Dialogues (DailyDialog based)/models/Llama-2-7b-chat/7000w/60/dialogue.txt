Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today? 
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! It can be good to try new things and challenge yourself. How was the rock climbing? Did you have fun? 
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 I'm glad you're enjoying the movie! What's your favorite part so far?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Haha that's great! It can be nice to have movie recommendations from someone who's seen the same thing and knows what they'
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Lots of fun and good exercise too! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I've been here from the very beginning and look forward to all that winter fun to come! </s>s are like you and your good movie
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Australia's definitely great too  I was thinking more like when you are going to visit the southern lights from here but winter can be good fun out
