Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	😂 My apologies! Let me rephrase the question: when did you first become interested in pastry crafting?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	😊 I'm just good at my job! So, how did you get into cake decorating? What inspired you to
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	actually I'm a food-soul chef 🙂 and my powers come from the good that I create!<|im_
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm a cake chef and the all time best in my book 🙂 Creepy how good that guess was Are you
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I can't claim that vegetables are the best part about cake eating And work for you? How fun and creative you are
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	😂😂 I can't dance for the life of me And you work in a cool and fun cake shop
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I can imagine that being a very nice work environment Sounds like you have fun and the same cakes which are for good reason ���
