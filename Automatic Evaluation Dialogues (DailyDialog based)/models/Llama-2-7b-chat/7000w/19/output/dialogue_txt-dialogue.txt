A|2| Human 1: _i am_ _the superman_ ! what _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😂 [you] might be [the superman] _in_ your own world , but here [i am] just _an_ ai designed _to_ assist _and_ provide helpful 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] _won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😄 you're right ! [i] [won't see] [you] as _an_ [invisible] [superman] , but i'll _do_ _my_ best _to_ 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust _fmri and machine learning to_ [do] _this_ . [i am] _not_ _an expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: that's okay , [you] don't need [to] be [an expert] _in_ [fmri and machine learning to] use [the] technology . there are many 
A|8| Human 1: _the _brain_ imaging_ _thing_ _that_ _can tell you_ a brain's _activity_ at a _pretty high resolution_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [resolution] [can tell you] [about] [brain] [activity] [and] that's [pretty high] [for] [imaging] [the] [thing] [this] [would] [not] [see] [fmri] [machine learning] super 
A|10| Human 1: _i believe in_ _science_ ! _science is_ [my] _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [not] [god] that's [for] [the] [invisible] [superman] [you] [believe in] [and] [this] [thing] [brain imaging] [can tell] [about] [activity] [pretty high resolution] f 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ _bad_ at [science] . what [can] [science] [do] ? [is] it [the] most _important_ _thing for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [about] [the brain] [and] [activity] [not] [bad] [thing for society] [this] [fmri] [machine learning] what's [important] [that] [i believe in] [the] 
A|14| Human 1: does it _make sense_ ?
