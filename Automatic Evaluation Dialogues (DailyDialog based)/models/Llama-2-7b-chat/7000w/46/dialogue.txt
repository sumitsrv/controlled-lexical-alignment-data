Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help. Please go ahead and share the scenario with me.</|im_end|> </s></s>
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I see. It's not uncommon for friendships to take a backseat during a falling out between individuals, and it can be difficult
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	That's understandable. It can be challenging to navigate friendships during difficult times, especially when someone has been a good friend for a long
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	Lol, not the avoiding texts advice 😅 But for real, it's good to have someone to talk to and lean
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's good that you have someone to talk to during this difficult time.  often say the balance means they never have it but always like to
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm not single though lol but that balance is what they say it is It means find someone who is always there for the person need
