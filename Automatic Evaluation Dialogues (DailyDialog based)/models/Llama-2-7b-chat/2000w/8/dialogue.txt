Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have weekends or personal experiences, but I'm here to help you in any way
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤒 Is there anything I can do to help?<|im
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have the budget for travelling 😊 How did you enjoy your travels this year? Did you visit any
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I have the budget for travelling 😊 How did you enjoy your plans this year? Did you go anywhere exciting?<|
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	lotion 😂 It's good you have Hawaii to look forward too! I'm going there for the first time this
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	It's important to be lotion for the whole day 😂 I'm going there for the first time this year too!
