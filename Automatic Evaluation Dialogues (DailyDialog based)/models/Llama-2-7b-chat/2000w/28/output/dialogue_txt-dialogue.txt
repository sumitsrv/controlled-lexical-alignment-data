A|6| Human 1: ha , that's true . if _you could_ only _eat_ _one_ _food_ _forever_ , _what_ _would_ it _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [would] _have_ _to say_ [a] tie between pizza [and] ice cream [. i] [could] [eat] both _of those_ [forever] !

A|10| Human 1: brilliant [. i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [the question] _is_ [great] because it's [one] [that] [could] spark [a] fun [and] interesting conversation . it's [always] interesting [to] see [what] [other] people 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . [what] sort [of] _food_ do [you] feel [like] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [you could] [say] [that] about [a] lot [of] foods , actually ! what's [your] go-to comfort [food] ? [that] one's [always] 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , [they] [have] franchises everywhere . [all] their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
