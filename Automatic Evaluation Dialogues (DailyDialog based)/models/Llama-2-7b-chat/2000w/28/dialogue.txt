Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! breakfast is an important meal to kickstart your day. Is there anything else you'd like to chat
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	haha, eggs and hash browns are a great breakfast choice! They're high in protein and can give you the energy you need to start
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I would have to say a tie between pizza and ice cream. I could eat both of those forever!
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I'd say those complete foods would be a good option! They provide all the nutrients you need in one convenient package. Plus,
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I think the question is great because it's one that could spark a fun and interesting conversation. It's always interesting to see what other people
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I think you could say that about a lot of foods, actually! What's your go-to comfort food? That one's always
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
