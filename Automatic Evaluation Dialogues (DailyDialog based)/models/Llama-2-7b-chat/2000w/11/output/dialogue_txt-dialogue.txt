A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can certainly help [you] _with_ your flower- 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] popular choice ! _it's_ [a] symbol _of_ beauty , purity _, and_ spiritual growth in many cultures 
A|6| Human 1: _oh ,_ [it's] _not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] _theory_ . [i] _think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ more revealing [of] _personality_ than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ [the] case , but [it's] an interesting [theory] ! can [you] [think] [of] any other [personal] [preferences] [that] might 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [oh _,] that's a_ great [flower] too ! [it] [does] [have a] cute [and] playful vibe [to] [it] , doesn't [it] ? < 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what their favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what _we_ [just] did . [does] [that] _make_ sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: 👀 [i'm] [just] an ai [and] [you] [are] [the] [flower] investigator ! [we] [make] [a] great team ! ��� 
A|12| Human 1: _cool_ . _step_ 2: talk _with the person_ some more [, and] ask them some more questions [, and] _gradually_ develop [a] sense [of] what they're _like_ , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [cool] ! [it's like] you're [gradually] building [a] [flower] [personality] profile [with the person] 😄 [step] 3: once 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] [, that's a] wonderful idea !
