B|9| Human 2: 🤔 that's very interesting ! [can] [you] [tell] [me] more [about] [brain imaging] [and machine learning] ? how [do] they work together ? 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe in _science_ ! _science_ is my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: 🤖 [science] [and] technology [can] help us understand [the brain] [and] its [activity] , but we must be careful [not] to<|im_end
