Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	😂 Well, you know what they say: pastry chefs are like magicians, they make delicious treats appear out
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	🤔 I guess you can say that! But actually, pastry chefs are more like scientists, they're always experiment
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	😂 that's a funny and not too far-fetched idea actually! I have a food aura detector app
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm a cake chef too actually! And the best part about that is you have all the authority and food powers
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	🤔 work for a food delivery app that's all about cake and the power of claiming vegetables<|im_
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	😂 cool? you can feel the dance floor shaking too! I'm a part-time cake chef and full time
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	😔 that can get a bit same-old for the cake enthusiast like myself
