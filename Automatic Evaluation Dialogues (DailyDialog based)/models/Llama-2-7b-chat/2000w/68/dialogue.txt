Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course, I'd be happy to help you understand some concepts! Can you tell me which topics you need help with?<|im_
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to attend lectures or discuss concepts in person. However, I can help you understand
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand the concepts for your test. Can you tell me which topics you have trouble with?<|
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	I'll cover the syllabus over the weekend. Can you help me understand some of the concepts that may not be that tough
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	I have the feeling that November will not be very hectic for you 😅 Can you help me with some test questions?<|
