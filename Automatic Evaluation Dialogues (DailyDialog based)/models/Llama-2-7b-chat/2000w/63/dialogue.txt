Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	That sounds like a lot of fun! I'll be happy to help you plan the trip. 🎉🎅<
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That sounds like a great plan! Disneyland definitely know how to put on a show for the holidays 😍. I would
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	😅 Yeah, you're probably right. Traffic around the holidays can be pretty bad. Might want to plan
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	🤔 That's not a bad idea. Airbnb can be a great option for staying close to Disneyland and still
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point. Christmas eve might be a little harder to find an Airbnb that is available 🤔 Let's keep looking
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	🎅❄️ for Christmas this year are <REDACTED_TERM> and a couple of fun little things
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	🎉 I think you might have a plan for that legos <REDACTED_TERM> and a couple of fun
