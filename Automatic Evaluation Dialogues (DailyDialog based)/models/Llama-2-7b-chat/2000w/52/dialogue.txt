Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Ah, yes! 😋 Microkitchen is giving out some tasty snacks today! 🥺 Would you
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Oh, that's great! 😊 Yes, the jacket is a great reward for completing some microkitchen missions
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Its good that the weather is cold for our jacket, don't you think? 😊
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Yeah! 😄 Where did you live before that the weather was nice for jackets?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Nice 😃 did you live in New york for long?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Sure! they should have some goodies for you 😊
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	😅 The one floor walk will take our time and the goodies might get gone before we can get there<|im_end
