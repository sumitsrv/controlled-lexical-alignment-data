Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Oh, yes! It's a very popular movie. The critics are raving about it. Have you seen it?<|im_end
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	I had a busy weekend last weekend. I did some errands and also saw a great comedy show. What about you?<|im
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	Yeah, the Mandalorian is great! Have you seen The Witcher? It's really good too! What did you think of
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	Marvel fan?  Me too! I'm excited for the new Captain Marvel movie. What do you think of Brie Larson as Captain Marvel
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I think you'll really enjoy Marvel movies, and don't worry too scary haha.  What other hobbies do you
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I've seen The Witcher too! It was really good, haha that actor is not the most attractive 😂
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	I've heard that Loki is not the most attractive actor too 😂 Marvel movies really bring out the worst in us
