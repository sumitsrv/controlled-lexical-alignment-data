A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what do _you think_ about_ _human_ _like_ chat _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're really cool ! _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize _the_ way _we_ interact _with_ technology . | 
A|4| Human 1: _yep ,_ [we] seemed [to] [have] made some great progress _over_ last few years . _do you _think the_ positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] , but it's important [to] _be_ aware _of_ [the] potential downsides [like] privacy concerns 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it sounds far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [yep ,] impersination _is_ definitely _a_ concern . but [like] [you] said , [it sounds far fetched] for _now_ . [what [do you think] the] future 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some [of] _these bots_ _are very_ engaging _and_ _funny_ . _they are_ [now] _good at_ _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how [far] _are_ [we] _from_ [the] _time_ _these bots_ start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they [are] very] [good at] [sarcasm] [and] _can_ [even] recognize [the] nuances [of] [human] language , [like] tone [and] context . it's [funny] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! [it] will signify how ai _research_ _has_ progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ [be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 😂 [the] [more] [you think about] [it] [the] [more] potential [it] [has] . [from] productivity [bots] [like] siri [and] google [now] [that] [can] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already [do] pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they [are] very] [good] [and] [can] [even] learn [the] user's preference [over] [time] 🙂 [the] [more] [you] engage _with_ [these bots] , 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [haha] [you] [might] [have] [the] patience [with] [this] [research] 😛
