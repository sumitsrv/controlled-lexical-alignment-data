Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	Weekends are great, but I'm here to help you 24/7! Is there something specific you'd like to chat about
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 Haha you're too fast! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or watch live sports events
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Haha you're funny! 😂 Although sharks are fascinating creatures, they can also be quite dangerous.
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	🤟 Haha you're really funny! You like UFC tournaments? 💥 <|im_
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm just really curious and outgoing like that haha 🤷‍♀️ You should try competing too! It can
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Yeah  I will definitely give that a try haha and pass out not funny at all lol!  It's been really great talking
