Human 2:	really fun haha yeah violent, I can imagine. I'll probably watch the live stream!
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Haha wow that's cool! Maybe you can teach me the basics of jiu jitsu sometime? ���
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	It's a great way to push myself and see how much I can actually do. Plus the competing atmosphere is really fun!<|im
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 I will make sure to not pass out this weekend during the tournament! It's just going to be me and some friendly but fierce
