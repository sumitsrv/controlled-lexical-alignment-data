Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	That's too bad. Would you like to talk about it? I'm here to listen. Sometimes talking about work-related stress can help
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	That sounds great! I'm sure you deserve a break after working hard all year round. Do you have any plans for the holiday?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	Do you like to travel? You have any fun trips planned for the holiday? 😃 
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	😃 that's great! Running can be really fun and it's great for your health too! Do you have any favorite
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	🤔 yeah, I've noticed that too! So, what's your favorite hobby?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	😲 wow, that's amazing! I've never run a marathon before, but I'm definitely interested
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	I see. Well, running half-marathons is still a great accomplishment! What inspires you to run?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	🤔 That's cool! What do you like to do to relax and unwind after a run?<|im_end
