Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Unfortunately, microkitchen is not within my knowledge base. However, I can suggest some other options for you. Would you like me to assist you
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Ah, I see! 😊 Well, if you're looking for a jacket, I can definitely help you with that!
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Yes, that's true! 💕 cold weather can be challenging, especially for outdoor activities. But don't worry
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	I see! 😊 So, what do you prefer for the weather in your new place?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😂 Yes, the cold weather can be a challenge, but it's doable! And you're right, New York
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	😅 Oh goodness gracious! Where did I put that nice warm sweater? Anyways, it's time for us
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	The one on the floor 😋 .
