Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	Oh, that's great! 😊 Watching the game can be a lot of fun, especially with friends and family. 
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 Oh, great! 😊 How long will you be staying in spain for the game?<|im_end|
