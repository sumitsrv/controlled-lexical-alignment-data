Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🤖, I don't have a day going, but I'm here to help you
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or a specific class 😅 But I'm here
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	That sounds great! I'm sure you're really good at pottery 🎨 What kind of things do you make with it
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	🙌 That sounds like a great way to relax and be creative at the same time! What's your favorite tea drink?
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	🎨 It's great that you make pottery! What kind of things do you like to make with it? Are there any
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Japanese teas are really nice 😊 What kind of pottery do you like to make? Are there any
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	Ah, that's great! I love trying new tea blends. What kind of pottery do you like to make? Are there any specific
