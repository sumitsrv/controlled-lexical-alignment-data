A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _good_ ! _just_ went _to_ _the_ park _to_ enjoy _the_ sun . _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: nice ! 🌞 _i'm_ [just] hanging out here , chatting with users _like you_ . [it's] been a [good] _day_ 
A|4| Human 1: _haha ,_ beach season is coming ! [you] _need_ _to_ look _tan_ ! what did [you] do _indoors all day_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [haha ,] [tan] ? 😂 _i'm_ [just] an ai , _i_ don't [need] [tan] <|im_end| 
A|6| Human 1: hahahaha , _that's_ pretty _funny_ . ever thought of bringing [your] _work_ things _to_ _the_ beach ?? 
B|7| Human 2: 🤔 _i'm_ [just] kidding ! [haha] . [just] [funny] _you work_ [indoors all day] too �� 
A|8| Human 1: _hmm_ _i see_ . it sounds [like [you] work] near _the_ water already , no ? _are you_ some kind of fish researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: 🤔 [hmm] , you're kinda fishy 😏 [are you] a spy ? or perhaps a marine bi 
A|10| Human 1: woah ! this is _very interesting _!_ i_ have honestly never heard of such kind of [work] . is it _dangerous_ at [all] ? 
B|11| Human 2: 🤔 [hmm] , you're right [! i] [work] in a [very interesting] field ! [it's] _not_ [dangerous] , though ! � 
A|12| Human 1: hmmm , yes [i] have heard that . apparently most _mountain climbers_ fall [not] on _the_ most [dangerous] routes , but on _the_ easier routes , when their guard is down ! sounds [like] _the same_ psychological phenomenon . 
B|13| Human 2: [haha] [that's] [very interesting !] 🤔 so [you work] in [the same] field as [the] [mountain climbers] [i see] ? � 
A|14| Human 1: [i'm] pretty amateur [! i] [like] _to_ climb at _indoor climbing gyms_ and have never gone outside on [dangerous] routes _actually_ . ever tried it yourself ? 
B|15| Human 2: ah [i see] ! well , [indoor climbing gyms] [are] great ! 🏔️ [it's] [actually] [very] similar [to] [mountain]
