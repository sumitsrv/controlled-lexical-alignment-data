B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers _if_ 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory ._ why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ [a] popular symbol in many cultures _and_ religions _. it's_ known for its beautiful _and_ fragrant blooms , 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] _theory ._ [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] are _more_ revealing [of] personality than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] see . _that's_ an interesting [theory _.] it's_ true [that] [people] can reveal [a] lot about themselves through [the] things they _like_ _and_ prefer 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ [. it's] [like] [a] cartoon [flower] . _as if_ [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came _to_ life .

B|11| Human 2: [it] [does] [make sense] , but [you] might want [to] be aware [that] people's [preferences] can be influenced by various factors [like] [their] cultural background , [personal] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk _with the person_ some _more_ , [and] ask them some _more_ _questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: ah , [i] see . _that's a_ [more] in-depth approach . by asking [questions] [and] engaging in conversations [with the person] [over] [a] period
