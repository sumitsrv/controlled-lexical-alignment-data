Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	Avatar is a classic, but I'm a big fan of Inception. what do you think of Leo DiCaprio's acting?
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
