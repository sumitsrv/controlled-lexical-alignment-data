Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	I'm good, thank you for asking! It's great to have you here. How can I help you today?<|im_
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal plans or experiences like humans do. However, I'm here to help you
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	Yeah, cold weather can be beautiful too! It's great for outdoor activities like skiing or ice skating. What do you
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	Kingyo is a great place! It's a popular spot for Japanese food in the city. What do you think of it?<|im
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	Nice! It's always good to have someone to show you around and introduce you to new places. What did you think of the food there?
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	It's great that you have the opportunity to attend these conferences! What do you think is the best part of them? Is it the networking
