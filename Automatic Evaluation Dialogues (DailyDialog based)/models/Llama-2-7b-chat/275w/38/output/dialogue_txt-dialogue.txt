A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed to have made some _great_ progress over last few years . do _you_ _think the positives_ _outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: well , _i [think_ the positives] definitely [outweigh the negatives] . [chat bots] _can_ provide 24/7 support , answer frequently asked 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _haha ,_ you're right ! _that_ could _be_ _a_ challenge . _how_ [about] privacy _and_ security ? 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! some _of_ _these_ [bots] _are_ very engaging [and] funny _. _they_ are_ now good _at_ even sarcasm [i] wonder [how] far _are_ we from [the] time _these_ [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: _haha_ that's an interesting thought ! [they are] getting _better_ _and better_ [at] understanding [the] nuances [of] [human] communication , _so_ it's not entirely 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ _implication_ is also huge _! it_ will signify [how] _ai research_ has progressed [so] far [and better] place to tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like_ stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling _it_ [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] that's [a] [great] point ! [the] implications [of] chatbots [and] [ai research] [are] far-reaching [and] exciting [. they] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂
