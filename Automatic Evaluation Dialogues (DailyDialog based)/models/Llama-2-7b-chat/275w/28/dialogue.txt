Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! Breakfast is definitely an important meal. What did you have for breakfast today?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Eggs and hash browns are a great breakfast choice! They're high in protein and can give you a boost of energy for the day
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	Interesting question! I think I would have to say pizza. I could eat it for every meal and never get tired of it.
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	Soylent would indeed defeat the purpose of the question! I think I'm going to say... tacos! Yeah, those could never
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	😂
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm stuck. What if I said hamburgers? That would be a food that I could eat for every
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
