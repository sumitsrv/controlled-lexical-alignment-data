Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or attend parties.  
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or memories of past events, including parties or turkeys. 
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Do you have any funny stories or jokes to share?
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or cooking skills, so I can't provide you with any fun
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	got it Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or feelings, so I can't say that I had fun at any
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 that sounds like a fun and creative game! Pictionary is always a classic choice too. Did you have any fun Thanksgiving dishes
