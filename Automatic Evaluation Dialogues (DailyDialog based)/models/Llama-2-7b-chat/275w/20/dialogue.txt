Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a great choice! Stirfry is delicious. How about if you could only listen to one type of music for the rest
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	Ah, ice cream is also amazing! If you could meet one historical figure, who would it be?
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Wow, you have a great taste in ice cream! If I could meet one historical figure, I would choose Leonardo da Vinci.
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	🤖 I'm just an AI and do not have personal opinions or emotions. However, the concept of an afterlife
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	🤖 That's a fascinating topic. Do you think there could be any possibility of extraterrestrial life?<
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have personal experiences or emotions, so I cannot provide supernatural experiences or anything of the sort.
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
