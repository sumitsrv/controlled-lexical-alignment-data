Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Oh no, that's unfortunate! Sorry to hear that. Would you like me to call the shop and check on your moped for
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	LOL! Oh man, that's funny! Don't worry about it too much, but do make sure to get it fixed soon
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	No, you're good! I actually work here and I have been able to walk to work today, but I don't know how that
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Warriors game? That's the NBA team that plays in San Francisco, right? Did you catch the game last night?<|im_
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Haha you're absolutely right! 😂 Did you think they would be able to bounce back from their last loss?<
