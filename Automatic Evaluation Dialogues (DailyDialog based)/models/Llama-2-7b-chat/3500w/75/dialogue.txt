Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	My apologies, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to recall past interactions or met you in person. However
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to dance or interact with you in a physical sense. I'm here
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Did you have a schwasty experience?
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm just LLaMA a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, I don't have a physical body or practice cardiology
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm LLaMA not sure what that is. It's okay, you don't have to know everything! ���
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm sure you have a real job that I know of.  You don't have to explain what LLaMA is to me.
