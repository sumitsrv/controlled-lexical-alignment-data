Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Sorry to hear that! Losing your moped can be so frustrating. How long do you think the repair will take?<|
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	lol that's hilarious! so diesel moped eh? I bet that wasn't the most fun way to get
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	No don't worry about that! the shop is near work so they'll be able to finish it today and you can pick it up then
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Warriors game?  Did you catch the last one they lost that game btw lol
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Haha you're right 😂 but their last game was a hard-fought loss, that's for sure! b
