A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] [flower] ! _that's a_ great choice 💜 [the lotus] _is_ [a] symbol _of_ spiritual growth _and_ enlight 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! [just] [a] [personal] theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality _than_ people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] saying [that] [you] [are] [the lotus] [flower] [personality] 😅 , but _it_ [does] reveal [more] [than people] [think] . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera _. it's like a_ cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" with [a] crayon _and then_ [it] came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] [the] [flower] [that] [people] prefer reveals [more] about _their_ [personality than] they [think] [. it's like a] subconscious cue [and] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ someone what _their favourite flower_ [is] . pretty much [like] what we [just] did . [does] [that] _make_ sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] 💜 [it] when [people] [ask] [you] [their favourite flower] [and then] [make] assumptions about [their] [personality] [just] [like] [that] ��� 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person _some_ [more] , [and] _ask them_ _some_ [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] _maybe_ _two to five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: 😂 [two to five years] [is] [a] long time , [maybe] [you] could [just] [ask them] [their favourite flower] [and then] [make] [some] assumptions [like] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
