Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting 😂 horse racing isn't really my thing, but I'm good! How about we chat about something
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It had been about a week since I'd last seen my friends. How long had it been for you?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?

Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going there with some friends 🌟 Tokyo is like the coolest city ever because you got over 9
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
