Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	I think human like chat bots are a fascinating area of research and development. Here's why: 🤖
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	😂 Yes, impersorsination is a great example. While human like chat bots have the potential to revolutionize customer service
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 Haha, good point! They are already very human-like and have the potential to do that
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	🚀 The moon landing has many implications and stepping into the futuristic problems will also have huge research progress like that o
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The auto-suggestions are already good 🙂 and the research has more implication like that o<|im_end|
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 The conversation with you has also progressed pretty far already! Nice having this chat with you haha! �������
