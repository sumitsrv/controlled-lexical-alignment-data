Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How about you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	Oh, I'm good 😊 Thanks for your concern! How about you watch the game with me? 👀
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have the capability watch basketball games 🤖 <|im_end|
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	Haha, I'd watch a game with the New York Chairs 😂 Who's your team? <|im_
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	I'm the New York NeurIPS 🤖 
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm the New York Chairs, that is! Haha, naming conventions are something else, aren't
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 What's that?
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I see Wall-e all the time, but this sounds very different
