Human 2:	Lots of twists and turns? Like the movie 😅🍿🎬 How was your Thanksgiving

Human 2:	Yeah, it's good to have some fun and adventure in the dark 😜 What about you, do you like scary
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	originally I'm from the southern lights 😅 nice and dark all winter but it was very cold. Where are you from?<
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Ah very nice 😊 I've been to visit once but it was too brief and I regret not going more often! Where are
