Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been going well, thank you for asking! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤒 Is there anything I can do to help? And don
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I did have the most amazing week this time last year 🌟 Do you think you'll get out for December too?<
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I have plans for the year but December has a lot of big things in it too! How's your budget looking this year?<|
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	I'll have the budget for it  this year cause It's going good with lotion there too! 🤣 Hawaii
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I'm going for the whole week this year cause it's important to have lotion there too. It's like a holiday
