Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Yes, I do! I love sunflowers.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can tell you that the lotus flower is
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Well, it's certainly interesting.  Why do you think the lotus flower is revealing of personality?<
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm not sure that the lotus flower and cartoon are the best comparison, but it does have a certain whimsical quality to it
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 The more someone values the flower's appearance and color, the more it reflects their personality. It just seems people like you are that
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	It's not that you have to talk with them for 2-5 years, it's more like the personality reveals itself over
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
