A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do _you_ _have_ a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: yes , _i_ [do] ! _i_ love sunflowers . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory _. why_ _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ experiences or emotions , but _i_ can tell [you] _that_ [the lotus] _flower is_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, _it's_ not_ research ! [just] _a_ [personal] theory . [i] _think_ [that] [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ _revealing of personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: ah , [i] see ! well [, it's] certainly interesting [. why] [do you] [think] [the lotus] _flower is_ [revealing of personality] ? < 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ _a_ _cartoon_ [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ _a_ crayon _and_ then _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure [that] [the lotus] [flower] [and] [cartoon] [are] [the] best comparison , but [it] [does] [have a] certain whimsical quality [to] [it] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ what _their_ favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [more] [someone] values [the] flower's appearance [and] color , [the] [more] [it] reflects [their] [personality] . [it] [just] seems [people] [like] [you] [are] [that] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk with_ [the] person some [more] , [and] ask _them_ some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's not] [that] [you have] [to] [talk with] [them] for 2-5 [years] [, it's] [more] [like] [the] [personality] reveals itself [over] 
A|14| Human 1: [why] thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
