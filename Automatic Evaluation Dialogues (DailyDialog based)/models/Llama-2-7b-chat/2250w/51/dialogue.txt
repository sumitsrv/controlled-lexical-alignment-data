Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 😊 horse racing is a popular sport. How about you? What do you do for fun?<|
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😂 Ah, I see! Well, friends are great to catch up with. How long had it been since you last saw them
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, so I don't have personal experiences like that. 📸 but some friends had tried deep
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually super excited about going on that deep sea fishing trip with some friends 🎣 It's been on my bucket
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	actually I'm going for the first time 😅 It's been on my bucket list for a while now, so I can
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is actually very cool 🙂 Have you been there before? I'd like to visit some family friends over there someday
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've been there 3 times actually! It never get old! Tokyo has such an unique culture and the food is amazing, you have
