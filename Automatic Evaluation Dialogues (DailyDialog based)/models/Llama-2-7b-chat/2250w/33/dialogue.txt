Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants! They're definitely one of the more challenging pastries to make, but I'm sure you'll do
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I've made them all! 😆 Okay, but seriously, croissants are a great challenge to have. It takes some
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! What kind of tips have you found helpful for making them flakey?
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'll have to give that a try next time. Now, you say you've made croissants once or twice. Would you mind
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	But I have to say, the thought of all that butter and sugar in croissants does make me a little hesitant to try them
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'd try to make croissants and get all the ingredients out when you say that <REDACTED_TERM>
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
