A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to make croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! they're definitely one _of_ _the_ more challenging _pastries_ [to make] _, but_ [i'm] sure you'll do 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ _once or twice_ _so_ far [, but] they haven't been _flakey_ enough . [i'm] trying [to] figure _out_ why . _what kind of_ cookies _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] [them] _all_ ! 😆 okay [, but] seriously , [croissants] are _a_ [great] challenge [to] [have] . _it_ takes _some_ 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] _think_ [so] ! [what kind of] tips [have you] found helpful for making [them] [flakey] ? 
A|8| Human 1: _now_ _that_ is [a] good idea . _i'll_ _give_ [it] _a try next time _._ would _you_ say_ [you] [have] [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to] [give] [that] [a try next time .] [now] , [you say] you've [made] [croissants] [once or twice] [. would you] mind 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people don't ! [but] yeah , _me_ too , _i_ [think] _i'd_ eat [pastries] _all the_ [time] if _i_ could _get_ away with [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [but] [i] [have] [to] [say] , [the] [thought] [of] [all] [that] butter _and_ sugar in [croissants] does [make] [me] [a] little hesitant [to] [try] [them] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was _when_ _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'd] [try] [to make croissants] [and] [get] [all the] ingredients [out] [when] [you say] [that] [<redacted_term>] 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
