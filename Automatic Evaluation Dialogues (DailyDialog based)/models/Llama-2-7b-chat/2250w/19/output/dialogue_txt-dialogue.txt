A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ _rather_ trust _fmri_ [and] _machine learning_ [to] [do] _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ [an] expert _on_ _that_ . sorry _for_ [it] ! 
B|7| Human 2: 🤔 that's okay , [not] everyone has expertise _in_ [machine learning] [and] [fmri] _. what_ [would] [you] [rather] [do] if [you] 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain_ imaging thing _that_ _can tell_ [you] [a] brain's activity at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: 🤔 that's very interesting [! what] [would] [you] use [this] technology [for] ?

B|11| Human 2: 😅 [science] [can] be [a] powerful tool [for] understanding [the brain] [and] developing new treatments [for] brain-related conditions . it's _important_ 
A|12| Human 1: no , i'm bad at [science] [. what] [can] [science] [do] ? _is_ [it] [the] most [important] thing [for] _society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell] us [a] lot [about] [the brain] [and] its functioning , [and] [this] knowledge [can] be used [to] develop new treatments [for] brain-related conditions 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make_ sense ?
