Human 2:	have you got any mentee this time?
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.

Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	things like time management, work life  balance, goal setting and professional development
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle

Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
