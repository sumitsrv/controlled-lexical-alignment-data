A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman !_ what _about_ _you ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: 😮 [superman !] *insert [superman] theme music* that's awesome ! 😃 how _can_ [i] assist [you] 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't see _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: 😮 [invisible] [you] say ? *nerd alert* well _, i'm_ afraid [i] can't grant [you] _that_ superpower 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust _fmri_ _and machine learning_ [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on [that] . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: 😊 [not] _a_ problem ! [machine learning] [and] [fmri] are fascinating fields [that] are constantly evolving . there's always 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ _thing _that_ can tell you_ [a] brain's _activity_ at [a] _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: you're [not] [imaging] [a] [brain] [activity] [that can tell you] [about] [a] [superman] [would] be [pretty] cool ! *sarcasm* [i] don 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe in _science_ ! _science is_ my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] best [god] 😎 [would] [you] want [me] [to] write [a] poem [about] [brain imaging] [and machine learning] [for] [you ?] <| 
A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] _it_ [the] most _important_ _thing_ _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science is] [important] [for society] , but it's [not] [the] only [thing that] matters . other things like art , music , [and] culture [can] also have [a] 
A|14| Human 1: _does it_ _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: what's [the] point of [science] if [it] can't [make sense] 🤷‍♂️ [does it] serve [a] purpose ? <|
