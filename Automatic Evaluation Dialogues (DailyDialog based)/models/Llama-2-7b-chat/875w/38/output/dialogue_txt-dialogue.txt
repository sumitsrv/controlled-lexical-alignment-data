B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're really cool ! _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize _the_ way _we_ interact _with_ technology . | 
A|4| Human 1: yep , [we] seemed [to] [have] made _some_ great _progress_ over last few years . do _you_ _think the positives outweigh the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: well , [like] _with_ any technology , there _are_ [some] potential [negatives] [to] consider . but _on the_ whole , _i [think_ the positives outweigh the] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _haha ,_ yes exactly ! but _also_ [the] potential for over-reliance _on_ [chat bots] _and_ losing [human] interaction . |<|im_end 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! [some] _of_ these [bots] _are very_ engaging [and] funny . _they are_ _now_ _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder how far [are] [we] from [the] time these [bots] _start giving_ monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they [are] very] sophisticated [now] [and] _can_ understand [the] nuances [of] [human] language . [it] won't _be_ long before [they] [start giving] mon

[it] will signify how _ai research_ _has_ progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 🙂 yes , [the] [progress] in [ai research] [is] incredible [and] [has] [many] potential implications for various fields [. the] ability [of] [chat] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty good 🙂_
