Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Ah, yes! 😋 Microkitchen is giving out some tasty snacks today! 🥺 Would you
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	😂 Jacket? Haha, no worries! You can always grab some delicious microwaveable goodies instead!
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	🤔 You're right. Its tough to stay indoors when the weather is cold and lovely outdoors.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	🤔 Where I live now is nice, but its nothing compared to our beach vacation spot! 🏖️<
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😂 Sure are! New York is amazing! I've been there a few times for work and the energy is unmatch
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	😅 you're right! I'll get the last bag of popcorn before they're all gone! �
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	🚀 Sure, can you walk me through the process of getting there? I'm a bit lost in this floor<|im
