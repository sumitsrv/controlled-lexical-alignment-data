A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on [a] theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] ! yes _, that's a_ very elegant [flower] _that_ _is_ often associated _with_ spirituality _and_ enlightenment in many cult 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! just _a personal_ theory . [i] think [that] [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] curious , [are] [you] [more] [of] [a] sunflower _person_ or [a] lilac _person_ ? 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . _as_ if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon _and then_ _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure . [the gerbera] [does] [have a] playful [and] cheerful appearance [that] could be seen [as] cute or childlike . 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their favourite_ [flower] [is] . pretty much _like_ what we just did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: 👍 [. it's like] you're creating [a personal] [flower] dictionary [with] [their favourite] flowers [and then] comparing [it] [to] _the person_ 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk_ [with] [the person] [some] [more] [, and] ask _them_ [some] [more] questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's like] [you] [are] building [a] [flower] [personality] profile [with] [them] [, and] [the] [more] they [talk] [to] _you ,_ [the] [more] flowers [you] can add
