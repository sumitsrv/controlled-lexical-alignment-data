Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Sure, I have a large flower garden with many different types of flowers. Some of my favourites include roses, daisies, and
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	Ah, the lotus! Yes, that's a very elegant flower that is often associated with spirituality and enlightenment in many cult
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm curious, are you more of a sunflower person or a lilac person? 
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm not sure. The gerbera does have a playful and cheerful appearance that could be seen as cute or childlike.
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	👍. It's like you're creating a personal flower dictionary with their favourite flowers and then comparing it to the person
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 It's like you are building a flower personality profile with them, and the more they talk to you, the more flowers you can add
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
