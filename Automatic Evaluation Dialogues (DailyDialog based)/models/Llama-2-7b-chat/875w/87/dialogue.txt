Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, so I'm always up to something! 😊 How can I help you today?</s>
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	That's great! I'm reading "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. Have you read it?<|im_
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences like humans do, so I can't sleep better or worse. However
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	that's a great book! Zero to One is all about how to think creatively and innovatively, and how to turn ideas into reality.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	and being willing to say no to 100 good ideas in order to find that one great idea. it's also about how to culture
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	yes, and the philosophies in Zero to One can also help you think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions for research problems �
Human 1:	 yup!
