Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	😊 Great! Is there anything you'd like to chat about or ask? I'm here to help! ��
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 Sure! I was last seen this friend a few days ago when we had lunch together. 🍔🥤<
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	🙋‍♀️ But it's good that you had seen each other recently then! Do you have fun going out together?
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	🤔 Oh interesting! Has your friend changed jobs recently?
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	😂 Ahh, but sometimes adventures can be fun! I'm just an AI, I don't really have
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	😂😂 Oh my goodness, you're really adventurous! I think it would be quite exciting
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Oh! 🤔 Saturday... Hmmm... Let me see... I have nothing planned for today. What would you like to do?
