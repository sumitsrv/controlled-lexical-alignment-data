Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants are a great choice! They're a classic French pastry that can be a bit tricky to make, but with practice
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or make cookies, but I can certainly help you out with croissants
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I've been trying to figure out why my croissants haven't been flakey enough. Have you encountered this problem before?<
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or taste buds, but I can give you some tips on how
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI that can give you the best pastries in town! What kind of flakey croissants are you looking for
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I think that's when the baker was trying to get too fancy with the butter and <REDACTED_TERM> ratio
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
