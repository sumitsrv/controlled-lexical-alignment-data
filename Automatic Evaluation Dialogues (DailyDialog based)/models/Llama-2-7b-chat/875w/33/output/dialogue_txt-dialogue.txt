A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are _a_ [great] choice ! they're _a_ classic french pastry _that_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to make] _, but_ _with_ practice 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once _or_ twice so far [, but] they _haven't been flakey enough ._ _i'm_ _trying to figure out why_ . _what kind of_ _cookies_ _have you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal experiences [or] [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ can certainly help [you] [out] _with_ [croissants] 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] [trying to figure out why] my [croissants] [haven't been flakey enough .] [have you] encountered this problem before ? < 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] good idea . i'll _give_ it [a] try next time . would [you] say [you] [have] [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal preferences [or] taste buds [, but] _i_ can [give] [you] _some_ tips on [how] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people [don't] ! [but] yeah , me _too_ [, _i] think_ i'd eat _pastries_ all _the_ time if [i] could _get_ away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai [that] can [give] [you] [the] best [pastries] in town ! [what kind of] [flakey] [croissants] are [you] looking for 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ _<redacted_term>_ _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and_ caused all sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ [when] [the] baker [was] [trying to] [get] [too] fancy [with] [the] butter [and] [<redacted_term>] ratio 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
