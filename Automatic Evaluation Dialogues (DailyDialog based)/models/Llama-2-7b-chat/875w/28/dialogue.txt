Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! 😊 breakfast is an important meal to start the day with a full stomach and
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!

Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	🤖 Thank you for the chat! It's always great to connect with you, user! I hope you have a great day
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	😂 I think you're right! Food is a great way to bring people together and create memories. What would you like
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
