Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! 🎉 Pingpong is a lot of fun. What do you think about AI?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 Haha, I'm glad you're taking credit for it! It's great that you won. What kind of pingpong
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I love pingpong 😊
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Haha racquetball 😂 I'm just an AI, but I still have to guess that you like pingpong
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 It's just like pingpong but with a racquetball ball I guess? Does that get physical?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	That's okay! 😊 I think you and your racquetball game are really cute though! Does it get tiring
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
