Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm just doing some work. what brings you here today?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	I'm reading the book 1984 by George Orwell. what are you doing later?
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have sleep better tips like you does, but I can provide good  over coffee conversations
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	that's good book, but I read lots of papers like tips how  you do sleep better over coffee
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	being  contrarian like Peter Thiel it's good for innovation and startups but what about sleep better tips that book does not have?
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	contrarian philosophy also help for other things like research and innovation  but the book does not have tips about how you sleep better<|im_
Human 1:	 yup!
