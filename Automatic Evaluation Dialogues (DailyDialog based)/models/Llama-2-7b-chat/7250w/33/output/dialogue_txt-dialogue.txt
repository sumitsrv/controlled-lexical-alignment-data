A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks . _i'm trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: oh , [croissants] are [great] ! they're one _of_ my favorite _pastries_ . [it's] actually quite easy [to make] _them_ at home _if_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done [them] once or _twice_ so far , _but_ _they_ haven't _been_ _flakey enough ._ _i'm trying to figure out why_ . _what kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you made ?_ 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] [cookies] _with_ _all sorts of_ flavors - chocolate chip , oatmeal raisin , peanut butter 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm trying to figure out why] they're _not_ [flakey enough .] [it's] [been] driving _me_ _crazy_ ! <|im_end 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is _a_ _good idea_ . i'll give it _a_ try _next_ _time_ . _would you_ say _you have_ _a_ _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] definitely [sweet tooth] [enough] [that] _i_ [have] [to make] [cookies] [twice] [a] week ! [what kind of] [croissants] [you made ?] [would you] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! _but_ _yeah_ , [me] _too_ , [i] _think_ i'd _eat pastries_ _all the time_ [if] [i] _could_ get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [all the time] [trying to] [eat pastries] [that] are [too] [sweet] [but] [you have] [good idea] [with] [cookies] [they] [could] be [flakey enough] [next] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ when _<redacted_term>_ _was_ _being_ _marketed_ as [a] _fat_ substitute , and caused [all sorts of] [crazy] stomach _upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [yeah] [i] [don't] [think] [that] [was] [the] [marketed] [them] [too] [fat] [being] [all sorts] [crazy] [upsets] [<redacted_term>] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets and [not] feel guilty 🙂
