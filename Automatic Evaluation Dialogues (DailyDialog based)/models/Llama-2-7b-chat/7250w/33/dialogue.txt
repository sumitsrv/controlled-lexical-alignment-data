Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Oh, croissants are great! They're one of my favorite pastries. It's actually quite easy to make them at home if
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I've made cookies with all sorts of flavors - chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm trying to figure out why they're not flakey enough. It's been driving me crazy!<|im_end
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm definitely sweet tooth enough that I have  to make cookies twice a week! What kind of croissants you made? Would you
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I'm all the time trying to eat pastries that are too sweet but you have good idea with cookies they could be flakey enough next
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	yeah I don't think that was the marketed them too fat being all sorts crazy upsets <REDACTED_TERM>
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
