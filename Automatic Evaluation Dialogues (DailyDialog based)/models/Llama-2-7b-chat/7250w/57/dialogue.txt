Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	How's your dive <REDACTED_TERM> Australia
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	I've been places that you can explore and see the amazing <REDACTED_TERM> It just one day wishs sometimes
