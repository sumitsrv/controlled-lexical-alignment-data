Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Christmas trip? That sounds like a lot of fun! I would want to know more details and you can join the discussion for more suggestions. 
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	23rd for the drive would you want us to join and stay with you then? Or would Christmas eve events be fun for kids
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Traffic might be harsh then will you join the fun Christmas eve events and stay for 3 nights? That would be Great idea!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Great! Let me know about the Airbnb and will join in for sure. Looking forward to have you  Christmas trip fun events!<|
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Christmas eve events can vary in the 23rd would you want us to look for that then and join in on christmas night or will
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	M <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time are you getting for your Christmas trip 2 nights in Airbnb close
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Sure, I can take that lead. What are your <REDACTED_TERM> year old son would love for Christmas this time around
