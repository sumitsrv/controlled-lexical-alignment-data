Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been busy, but I'm here to help you with any questions you may have. How can I assist you today?<|im
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell 🤒. Resting and self-care are the best ways
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have a budget for the year 💰. How did your travelling this year go?<|im_
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'll have big plans for 2023 too! How did you like the year 2022?<|im_
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	I'm going there for the humidity 😅 It's good to have you back! How has your year been?
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😅 I'm the same way! It's like, you never have to worry about lotion for your day �
