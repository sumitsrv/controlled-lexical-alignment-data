Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's interesting! Stirfry is a delicious choice. What about you if you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 That's great! What if you could meet one Food Personality, who would it be and why?
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	That's great! Cookies and Cream is one of the variations you like more. How about Food Challenges? What would you do
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	nice sorbet and smoothies you like. Changing topics, What's the latest Food trend you're into  right now?<
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 you think there must something more than the physical world as understand it. What would you like to say about Food and Moods? How does
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	That's a great question! Food and Moods have ever had the most supernatural experience you think there must something more than physical world understand
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
