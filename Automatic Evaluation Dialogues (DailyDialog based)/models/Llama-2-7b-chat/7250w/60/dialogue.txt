Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a good way to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. How was the experience?</
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	What movie did you go see? It's great to have the ability to experience new things and challenge yourself. How was your climbing experience?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahaha nice! Yeah they can be very twisty and turns! What was your climbing experience like? How's the movie?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 What's the movie about? Evening runs can be fun but it can be scary when dark out! How was that climbing experience
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	Hahah I see what you're saying but from here it can get very dark and the lights are more fun that way  But winter was
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I see  Ahh nice! Australia can definitely try that too! What's the scariest movie you've seen? Evening runs
