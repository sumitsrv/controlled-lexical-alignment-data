Human 2:	That's great! Playing music can be very therapeutic and rewarding. Do you have a favorite guitar player or band?
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	🤣 Yeah, it can be frustrating at times, but the feeling of accomplishment when you finally master them is amazing
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	🤖 Yes, it's like a secret language. Once you know the chords, you can write your own songs and express
