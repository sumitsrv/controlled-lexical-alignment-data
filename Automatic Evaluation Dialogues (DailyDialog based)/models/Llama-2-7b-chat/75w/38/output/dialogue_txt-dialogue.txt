A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human like chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're really interesting _and_ _have_ _a_ lot _of_ potential ! _they_ _can_ help people communicate _with_ businesses _and_ organizations in _a_ _more_ personalized way 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ [have] made _some_ great _progress_ over last few years . do _you_ _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: yes , _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] , but it's important [to] _be_ aware _of_ [the] potential drawbacks _and_ [to] 
A|6| Human 1: like impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: oh , definitely ! impersonation _is_ _a_ big concern , _as_ _it can_ _be_ used [to] trick people into revealing sensitive information or [to] spread misinformation 
A|8| Human 1: true that _! some_ _of these_ bots _are_ very _engaging_ [and] funny . [they] _are_ now good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ _we_ from [the] time _these_ bots _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: (laughs) oh , [you] never know [! some] advanced _ai_ systems [are] _already_ capable [of] [engaging] in _conversation_ [and] [even] telling jokes . 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it can] take _many_ different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication [is] also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how [ai] research _has_ progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] like stepping _on_ [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: (smiling) indeed ! [ai] [has] [the] potential [to] revolutionize [many] fields , [and] [the] [progress] in chatbot technology [is] just [a] small step towards 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions [already] do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: yeah , [i think] [we] [will] [start] seeing [more] [of these] interactive conversations [and] [even] personalized recommendations based [on] user preferences [and] behavior . [it can] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having _this conversation_ [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: 😊 [and] [to] [think] , [this conversation] was facilitated by an [ai] assistant ! [the] future [is] indeed promising ! <|im
