Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	Haha, sounds like you’re having a good day! 😃 What’s up?
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	Oh no, what happened? 😔 Tell me everything!
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	And I'm feeling a bit drained and hopeless now 😔 
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	That's terrible to hear 😔 I'm here for you, and I'm sure we can figure something out together.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	Haha, damn! Well, you seem to be in a bit of a funk 😔 So, tell me what'
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	What's keto? 🤔
