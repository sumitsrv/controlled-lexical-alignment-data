A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do_ _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: sure ! _i_ _like_ daisies [a] lot . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on [a] _theory_ . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _it's_ [a] very symbolic [flower] _, and_ has different meanings in different cultures . in many eastern religions , [the lotus] _is_ seen 
A|6| Human 1: oh , [it's] not research ! just [a] personal _theory_ . _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences are _more_ _revealing_ _of_ _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: _that's_ an interesting [theory] ! [i think] _it_ might [have] [to] [do] _with the_ way [people] perceive beauty _and_ [the] subconscious associations they _make_ between 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like a_ _cartoon flower_ . as if _you_ drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [cartoon _flower] is_ [like a] character in [a] story [and] [it's] [revealing] something about [the] [personality] [of] _the person_ who likes it<| 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] _, you_ ask _someone_ what their favourite [flower is] . pretty much [like] what we just did . does _that_ [make] sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [and] [i'm] thinking [that] [the lotus] [flower] , in particular , reveals [someone] who [is] patient , wise _, and_ resilient , while [the] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with [the] person] some _more_ [, and] ask _them_ some _more questions_ [, and] gradually _develop a_ sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: yeah , [i think] _that's a_ great _idea !_ by asking [them] [more questions] [and] getting [to] know [them] better [over] time [, you] can [develop a] [more] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful [idea !]
