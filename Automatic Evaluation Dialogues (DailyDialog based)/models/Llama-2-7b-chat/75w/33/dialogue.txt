Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants! They're one of my favorite pastries. What's your favorite filling?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Flakey croissants can be tricky. It's important to make sure you're rolling out the dough
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	Yeah, I've made all sorts of cookies. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	😀 I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or taste buds, but I can give
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I think we all can relate to that feeling. 😂 But croissants are great for breakfast too! Have you ever tried making
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	Oh, yeah! I remember that! It's important to keep in mind that even though some ingredients may be marketed as healthier
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
