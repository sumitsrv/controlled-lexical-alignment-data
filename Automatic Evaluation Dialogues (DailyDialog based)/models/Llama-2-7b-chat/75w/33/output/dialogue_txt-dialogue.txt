A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once _or_ twice so far _, but_ they haven't been _flakey_ enough . _i'm_ trying _to_ figure _out_ why . what kind _of cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _ah _,_ i_ see ! [flakey] [croissants] can be tricky . [it's] important [to make] sure you're rolling [out] _the_ dough 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _yeah ,_ [i've] [made] _all sorts [of_ cookies] . chocolate chip , oatmeal raisin _, and_ peanut butter

A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being _marketed as_ a fat substitute [, and] caused [all sorts of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: oh , [yeah] ! [i] remember [that] ! [it's] important [to] keep in mind [that] even though [some] ingredients may be [marketed as] healthier 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
