Human 1:	 yea me too. I sometimes eat noodle soups in thanksgiving instead haha
Human 2:	That's interesting! Noodle soups are a common dish in many cultures, and they can be a great way to warm up
Human 1:	 me neither. someone told me that it depends on the stuffing inside the Turkey. some people make very good stuffing
Human 2:	That's true! Stuffing is a popular part of the Thanksgiving meal in the US. Some people make it with bread,
Human 1:	 yea. what do you plan to buy?
Human 2:	I think I'll buy some stuffing and maybe some mashed potatoes or green beans. what about you?<|im_end
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you can run more frequently?:)
Human 2:	No, I don't plan to run. I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to run or move around.
