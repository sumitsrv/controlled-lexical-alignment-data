Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a day going, but I'm here to help! How can I assist you
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have feelings or emotions, so I don't experience the weekend or any other
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	Are you going to watch the live stream of your favorite artist's concert? Or are you interested in watching a play or musical?<|im
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Are you looking forward to the next sharks live event? How can I help you prepare for it?
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	You're really going to the jiu jitsu tournament this weekend? Are you training to compete in it? How can I help
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm just training myself and have been competing really consistently over the past year. It actually can give you pretty good sharks training ha
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I'm really just there for the win and will consider that a successful outing haha have fun training this weekend!<|im_
