Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help. Please go ahead and scenario 
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	Ah, I see. It can be difficult when someone from your partner's past comes into the picture, especially when there are old friendships involved
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm not sure advice is the right word for this scenario, though. That might sound like raising treason because all are friends already during their
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	That's not the advice I would have given though. Lol, avoiding everyone might sound like treason  lol because all are friends
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	I've always used the advice that it's good to have  balance but not everyone agrees with me lol because what might be right
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	Lol single what's that like  I always find it the balance between all friends It might take time but with patience everyone will have their
