B|3| Human 2: of course ! i'd _be_ happy [to help] . please go ahead and [scenario] 
A|4| Human 1: my _partner's_ former friend invited _me_ _for_ lunch (they _are_ _not_ in _good_ books _right_ now) . _but_ _during their_ friendship _i_ formed an independent bond _with_ _the_ other person _because_ we _all_ _used_ [to] hang out a lot . now _i_ feel _like i_ _have_ [to] _take_ sides . 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [i] see _. it_ can _be_ difficult when [someone] _from_ your [partner's] past comes into [the] picture , especially when there [are] old friendships involved 
A|6| Human 1: [i] hope they do . getting older _already_ means smaller circles [. it] sucks [to] lose _friends_ _for_ arbitrary reasons . _that's_ _good_ _advice_ _though ._ [i] fear _raising_ [the] issue _might sound like treason_ _. lol_ . 
B|7| Human 2: _i'm_ [not] sure [advice] _is_ [the] [right] word [for] this [scenario] , [though .] _that_ [might sound like] [raising] [treason] [because] [all] [are] [friends] [already] [during their] 
A|8| Human 1: aka _avoiding_ [all] texts [from] _everyone_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [that's] [not] [the] [advice] [i] would [have] given [though [.] lol] , [avoiding] [everyone] [might sound like treason] [lol] [because] [all] [are] [friends] 
A|10| Human 1: people _always_ say [to] _find_ a _balance but_ never say _what_ _the balance_ [is] . _it's_ _used_ so often _that it's_ vacuous . 
B|11| Human 2: [i've] [always] [used] [the] [advice] [that it's] [good] [to] [have] [balance but] [not] [everyone] agrees [with] [me] [lol] [because] [what] [might] _be_ [right] 
A|12| Human 1: [lol] . [i'm] finna [be] _single_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [lol] [single] what's [that] [like i] [always] [find] [it] [the balance] between [all] [friends] [it] [might] [take] time [but] [with] patience [everyone] will [have] [their]
