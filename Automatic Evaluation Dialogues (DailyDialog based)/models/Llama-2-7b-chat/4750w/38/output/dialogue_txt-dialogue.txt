A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you think about_ human _like_ _chat_ bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: oh , [you] know , _i think_ they're _pretty_ cool ! 🤖 _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize _the_ way _we_ interact _with_ 
A|4| Human 1: _yep ,_ [we] seemed [to] [have] _made_ _some_ _great_ _progress_ over last few years . do _you think_ [the] positives outweigh _the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: well ... [like] [you] said 🤖 [progress] [have] been [made] , but [the negatives] can't _be_ ignored either . for example [some] [chat] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: 🙃 [yep ,] impersination _is_ _a_ [great] example . [like] [you] said [progress] [have] b 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] _of_ these bots _are _very_ engaging and_ _funny_ _. _they_ are_ now _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how _far_ _are_ [we] from [the] time these bots start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: 🤔 [monologues] [are] [funny] [that] [you think about] [it] [. they] [have] [the] potential [to] _be_ [very engaging and] [even] entertaining 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] _can_ take many different forms as [a] product _. the_ research _implication_ [is] also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai research has progressed so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort _of_ [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be_ _overselling it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 🤔 [overselling it] [might be] [the] understatement [of] [the] year [. the] [implication] [will] [have] [far] reaching [and] [are very] exciting 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do [pretty] _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] [like] [the current] chat-bots [that] [can] [auto-suggestions] [good] [already] [the] [implication] [will] [have] [far] reaching [and] [very] exciting 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [you think] ? [the] [implication] [will] [have] [far] reaching [and] [very] exciting
