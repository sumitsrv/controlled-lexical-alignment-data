Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going good, just helping customers like you! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! It can be good to try new things and get the blood pumping. How was rock climbing?<|im
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Yes! 😅 What's your favorite movie?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Lots of twists and turns, that's the movie 😂 Hahah nice! What do you recommend?<|
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	What's scary? 👻 Hahah nice, that movie was very good! Thanksgiving break and dark out runs
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I've been from here  Hahah nice winter break very fun! Lots and lots of lights actually are more than brief like they can
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I'd like that  definitely try visit Australia once more lights actually brief yes you should see southern light too nice winter fun good very fun<|
