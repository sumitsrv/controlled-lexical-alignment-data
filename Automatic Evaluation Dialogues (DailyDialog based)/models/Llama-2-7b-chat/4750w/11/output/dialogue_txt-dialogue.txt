A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: sure ! _i_ [have a] vast knowledge _of_ flowers _and_ can tell [you] all about _them_ . however , _i_ must inform [you] _that_ _i'm_ _just_ an 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on [a] theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad you're interested in [the lotus] [flower] ! _it's_ [a] symbol _of_ purity , spiritual growth _, and_ renewal

B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [and] ai [that] can assist [with] [personality] [research] . [the lotus] [flower] has [much] deeper meaning [than] [what] [it] appears [to] be 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] [, and] _ask them_ some [more] questions [, and] gradually _develop_ [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years _. and_ voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's] [more] [like] [you] [develop] [the] [personality] [over] time [and] [not] [just] [ask them] [what] they [are] [. and] [it's not] [step] 2 [that]
