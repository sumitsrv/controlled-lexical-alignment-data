Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	😅 Sorry, it looks like you're feeling a bit frustrated today! Is everything okay?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	🤪 Oh no! What happened? Tell me more about it.
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that 😔 project got shelved. It can be really tough when things don't
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	I'm here for you and I'm listening 👀 Would you like to talk about it some more or process your emotions
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	I'm glad you forgot 😅 how was your day going?
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	What's keto?
