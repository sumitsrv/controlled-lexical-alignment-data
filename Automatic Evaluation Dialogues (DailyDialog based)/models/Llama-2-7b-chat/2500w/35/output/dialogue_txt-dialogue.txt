A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: how's _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _so_ sleepy _today_ ! 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] here _to_ help ! 😴 _what_ would _you_ like _to_ chat _about_ or _do_ [today] ? 
A|4| Human 1: _yeah_ _was_ working _all_ night _on_ _a_ _homework_ 
B|5| Human 2: that's impressive ! 😅 did _you_ want _to_ talk _about_ [homework] or [was] there _something_ else [on] your _mind_ [today] ? < 
A|6| Human 1: _biology_ . [i'm] gonna _be a_ doc someday ha 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that _you_ have_ [a] passion _for_ medicine 👨‍⚖️ [biology] _can_ [be a] challenging 
A|8| Human 1: no _high school_ _actually_ haha 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ see 😅 what's been _the_ most challenging part _of_ [high school] _for_ _you_ [so] far ? <|im_end| 
A|10| Human 1: _i wanna_ [be a] _brain surgeon_ !! 
B|11| Human 2: that's quite _an_ ambitious goal 🤯 _do _you_ have_ _an_ interest in neuroscience ? <|im_end| 
A|12| Human 1: kind [of] _i think_ 
B|13| Human 2: [yeah] 👀 [i think] it's really cool how our brains are able _to_ process _and_ interpret [all] _the_ information we receive every day 
A|14| Human 1: is [that] [something] _you can_ _practice_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [yeah] [i wanna] [practice] _it_ _and_ [actually] help people _with_ [brain surgeon] stuff like [you] _do_ 
A|16| Human 1: [i] honestly thought [it] [was] _one_ [of] those _things_ [you have] [to] [be] born [with] ... not [that you] shouldn't try _though_ ! 
B|17| Human 2: [i'm] sure [you have] some [things] [that] [can] help [with] [brain] development [though] , right ? 
A|18| Human 1: _maybe_ its [a] little too early [to] _even_ [be] _thinking about_ this . just aim [for] _med school_ [and] enjoy [the] journey ! 
B|19| Human 2: you're 10 [and] [thinking about] [med school] [though] that's impressive [maybe] [one] day [you can] [even] [practice] [brain] surgery [on] me ! 
A|20| Human 1: [what] other subjects [do you] enjoy ? try [to] keep [an] open [mind] !
