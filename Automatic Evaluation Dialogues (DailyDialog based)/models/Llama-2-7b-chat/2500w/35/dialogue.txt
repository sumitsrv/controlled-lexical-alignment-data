Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	I'm here to help! 😴 What would you like to chat about or do today?
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	That's impressive! 😅 Did you want to talk about homework or was there something else on your mind today?<
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that you have a passion for medicine 👨‍⚖️ Biology can be a challenging
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	I see 😅 What's been the most challenging part of high school for you so far?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	That's quite an ambitious goal 🤯 Do you have an interest in neuroscience?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Yeah 👀 I think it's really cool how our brains are able to process and interpret all the information we receive every day
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 Yeah I wanna practice it and actually help people with brain surgeon stuff like you do
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I'm sure you have some things that can help with brain development though, right?
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	you're 10 and thinking about med school though that's impressive Maybe one day you can even practice brain surgery on me!
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
