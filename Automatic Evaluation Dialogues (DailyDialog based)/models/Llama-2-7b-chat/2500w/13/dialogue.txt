Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 lol Marvel fan here! What did you think of the latest Thor movie?
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I think you'll be fine 😊 watch the other Marvel movies and don't worry too much about scary scenes ha
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I think the actor that plays Spiderman is really great looking 😍 Have you seen any movies with him in it?<
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	I think Loki is the name of the other superhero that appears in the Marvel movies 🤔 haha<|im
