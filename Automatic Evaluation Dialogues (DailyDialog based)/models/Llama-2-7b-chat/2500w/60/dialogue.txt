Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a great way to challenge yourself and get some exercise. How was your experience?<|im_
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing sometimes. What's your favorite movie?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahaha nice! It's great that you and your friends could all relate to the movie. What was your favorite part?<|im
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Lots of fun little twists and turns that made it very entertaining. Thanksgiving break was good. Hahah same but darker
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	But you'd like winter more than I would, from the sound of it! What do you prefer about it?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Australia's definitely not too far from here actually  I was like you once. But winter can be very nice when it's done right<
