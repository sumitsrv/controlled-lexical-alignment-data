A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings . however , _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working _on_ _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ great cultural _and_ spiritual significance in many societies , including ancient egyptian , hindu _, and_ buddhist 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! [just] _a personal_ theory _. i_ _think_ _that_ _flower preferences_ _are more_ revealing [of] _personality_ _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ true . [just] because [you] _like_ [the lotus] [flower] doesn't mean [you] [are more] compassionate or 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera _. it's_ [like] [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure [that] [personality] can be judged based [on] [flower preferences] [. it's] [more] [of] [a personal] preference [and] [does] [not] [have] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ _what_ _their_ favourite [flower is] . pretty much [like] _what_ we [just] did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [just] [that] [you] [think] [people] [are more] [like] [their] [flower preferences] [than] [what] they actually [are] [. i] mean , [someone] who likes sunflow 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk with_ [the] person some [more] [, and] ask _them_ some [more] questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [more] [you] [talk with] [them] [and] [the] [more] they share [their] [personality] traits [that] [are] [not] [just] [flower preferences] , [the] [more] accurate [it] will be
