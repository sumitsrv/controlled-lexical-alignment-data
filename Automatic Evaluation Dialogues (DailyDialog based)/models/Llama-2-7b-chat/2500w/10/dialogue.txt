Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Nice, just hanging out
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Oh that's too bad... didn't you study well?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	Haha that's actually the opposite :') didn't Columbus live like 500 years ago?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	🤔 What's your next question?
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 Haha you're one of the weirdest people I've ever met :')
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	Just kidding 😜 But seriously, you should tell me your job so I can know how to answer your questions properly! 
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	🤔 That's very interesting. What made you want to become a horse?
