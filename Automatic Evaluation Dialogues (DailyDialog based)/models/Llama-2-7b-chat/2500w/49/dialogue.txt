Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	Haha wow you're going live!
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Haha violent? Hokey can't be that violent... or can it? 😅 
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Haha wow training can you like actually fight 😅
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm pretty competitive myself actually haha 💁‍♀️ and I like to try out the jiu jitsu
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Yeah that's actually pretty fun 😅 and competing can give you the best training haha. I have been really enjoying
