Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Great! I've been pretty busy with work. How about you?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been great catching up with you too! How long has it been since we last spoke?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm going sea fishing with friends next weekend actually! It's been 5 months since we last spoke. How about you?
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm thinking about going on a road trip with some friends. Have any fun plans yourself? It's been good catching up with you
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm actually going on a weekend getaway with friends soon. Just a 2day trip to nearby city. Have fun on your road
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking about going to Tokyo soon! Have you been there before? What did you think of it?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've never been there before either but have been dying to visit Tokyo! What about you? Have some fun plans yourself?<|im_
