Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	That's too bad.  Lol. But in all seriousness, many people have had miraculous experiences that have changed their lives
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	Lol. You're too cynical!  It's okay to believe in miracles even if you can't change people
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	It's not about shaping values, it's about what you believe and act accordingly too  You can say many good things about mira
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	It's good you have electricity now  What about the miracles people say get them through tough times? Are you not open to
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	What makes you sure people who grow up lacking things get miracles? Not everyone's got the same outlook on life<|im
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	ALL THEIR MONEY? What makes you think people who grow up lacking things have miracles? Not everyone's got the same
