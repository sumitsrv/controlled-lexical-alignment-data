Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 Sure! I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body, so I can't actually run marathons
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal plans or events to attend. My purpose is to assist users like you 2
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you doing any obstacle races soon?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Wow, that sounds like a great way to challenge yourself and have fun doing it! Are you planning any obstacle races in the coming months?
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 It's fun, but you need to be in good shape for the race. Its not for the faint of heart!<|im_
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's good 2-3 months for obstacle race training. Its not about the time you can run but about your abilities to work
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Will you be training for the Monterey obstacle race next month?
