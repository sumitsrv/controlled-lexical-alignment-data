Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	I'm afraid I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and do not have access to microkitchen's
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	I see. 😊 jacket giveaways are always a nice surprise. But I'm afraid I can't help you
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Its good that the weather is cold. Its much needed for our planet 😊
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 Sure! Where do you live?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	🤣 right! Its good you get the cold weather for a few more months though. New york's winters are always
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Nice 👍. So did you get the cold weather goodies?
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 Sure, that will be the best way to get there. should we walk right now? or can we take our time and get some other good
