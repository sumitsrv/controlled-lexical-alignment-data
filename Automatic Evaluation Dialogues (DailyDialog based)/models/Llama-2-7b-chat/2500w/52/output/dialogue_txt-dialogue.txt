A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ doing today ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ heard they [are] giving out _some_ _goodies_ in microkitchen . 
B|3| Human 2: i'm afraid [i] can't satisfy _your_ request , i'm just an ai _and_ do not have access _to_ microkitchen's 
A|4| Human 1: [i] guess _its_ _a_ _jacket_ ! very _much needed_ _that_ in _the cold_ 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] see . 😊 [jacket] giveaways [are] always [a] _nice_ surprise . but i'm afraid [i] can't help _you_ 
A|6| Human 1: _sure_ hate it ! limits _our_ ability [to] go out even _for a_ _walk_ _! _its good_ that_ _we_ don't _get_ [to] suffer extreme _cold weather_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [its good that] [the] [weather] is [cold] . [its] [much needed] [for] [our] planet 😊 
A|8| Human 1: oh [nice] _! where_ _did _you_ live_ before ? 
B|9| Human 2: [sure] [! where] do [you live] ? 
A|10| Human 1: _new_ york ! [nice] ! _best_ place [to] [live] 🙂 .. _right_ , except [for] _the cold_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: 🤣 [right] [! its good] [you] _get [the_ [cold] weather] [for a] few more months though . [new] york's winters [are] always 
A|12| Human 1: anyways , [i] guess _we_ _should_ better hurry up _to [get_ the] _goodies_ . [i] remember last _time_ they ran out of it . 
B|13| Human 2: [nice] 👍 . so [did you] [get [the] [cold] weather] [goodies] ? 
A|14| Human 1: [the] one in [our] floor . [i] _will_ [get] by [your] desk [and] _we_ _can_ _walk_ _there ._ 
B|15| Human 2: [sure] , [that] [will] be [the] [best] way [to get] [there .] [should] [we] [walk] [right] now ? or [can] [we] take [our] [time] [and] [get] [some] other [good]
