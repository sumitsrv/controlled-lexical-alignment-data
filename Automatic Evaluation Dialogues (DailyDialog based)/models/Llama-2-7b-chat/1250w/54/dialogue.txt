Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Oh great! *pauses*  What game did you play?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	I see. It's great that you won, but taking credit for something you didn't do is not very ethical.  *p
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	It's just that I don't have personal experiences, but you can still game with me. What would you like to do?<|
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Haha, I'm just an AI, I don't have racquetball experiences 😅 What game would you like
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, but I won't participate in any physical cage match ��
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 That's funny. I'm just an AI, I don't have physical abilities. What sport would you like to
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
