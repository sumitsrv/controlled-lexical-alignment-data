A|4| Human 1: [glad to] hear _you're_ _better_ . sorry [to] hear [you] were sick . _i was_ sick [a] couple _of_ weeks ago [with] [a] bad cough _. there's_ _definitely_ [a] bug _going around ._ admit _i just want to_ stay healthy [for] [the] holidays _and_ plan _to relax_ .

A|8| Human 1: [me] _too_ . [now] [i] _have_ folks come visit [me] [for] [the] holidays ! [but] that's _also_ tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i know] , right ? 😅 [but] hey , at least you'll [have] _some_ _nice_ time [with] [your] loved ones [and] that' 
A|10| Human 1: yes ! we set up an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas tree_ [and] put up [some] _colorful_ led _lights_ which is _very festive_ . 
B|11| Human 2: 🎄 [lights] [and] [tree] ! [i'm] [definitely] [going] [to] [have] [some] hot chocolate [and] [christmas] cookies [too] ! ��� 
A|12| Human 1: buying _a tree_ is [a] neat experience . _i was_ torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one _that_ smells _like_ fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] one _that_ we [can] disassemble every _year_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [there's] [also] [the] option [for] [a tree] [that] [can] be disassembled [and] re-used [like] [you] said [! [i] was] thinking [of] bu

[i] remember having real [christmas] _trees_ from childhood [, but] these days [with] climate _change_ , [i] _think_ not chopping down [a tree] [just] [to] decorate [it] _and then_ throw [it] out in [a] month is [the] more responsible thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [christmas tree] decorations [can] be [very festive] [and] [colorful] [! i like] [the] [lights] [that] [change] colors [and] [have] different patterns . [and then] [just] [think] 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store is _target_ , plus they _often_ [have] _good deals_ . 
B|17| Human 2: [target] [has] [good deals] [and] [also] [often] [has] [trees] [that] [can] be disassembled [for] re-use [year] after [year] ! 🙂 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i] hope [you] find [a] [nice] [tree] .
