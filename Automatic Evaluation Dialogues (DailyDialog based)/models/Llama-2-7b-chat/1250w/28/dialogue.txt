Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's great to hear! breakfast is a very important meal to give you the energy you need for the day ahead. Is there anything else
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Don't worry about it! A balanced breakfast is the key to a great day. Did you have any other healthy choices in your breakfast
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would say a good apple. They're healthy and delicious, and you could eat them forever without feeling guilty!<|im
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I think Soylent would be a great choice! It's a food that provides all the nutrients you need for the day in one
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	BRILLIANT. I love that you think Soylent would be the food that could keep you healthy and happy forever!<|
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I think you'd also want to consider the flavor of which food will make you feel forever healthy and happy forever 😋
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
