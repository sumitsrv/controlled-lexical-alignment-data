A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: i'm _great_ , thanks _. i_ just ate _a_ _delicious_ _breakfast_ , _which_ always sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ [great] _to_ hear ! [breakfast] _is_ [a] very important meal _to_ give _you_ [the] energy _you_ need for [the day] ahead . _is_ there anything else 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ had eggs _and_ hash browns . way less healthier than _your_ _apple_ , i'm afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: don't worry about _it_ ! [a] balanced [breakfast] _is_ [the] key _to_ [a] [great] [day] . did _you_ _have_ any _other_ healthy choices _in_ [your] [breakfast] 
A|6| Human 1: ha , [that's] true . if _you could_ only _eat_ _one_ _food_ _forever_ , what _would_ [it] _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [would] _say_ [a] good [apple] . they're healthy [and] [delicious] , [and] [you could] [eat] them [forever] without feeling guilty ! <|im 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange _would be a_ drawback ! _that_ turns my mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly _want to_ [say] _soylent_ or _one_ _of_ those [other] "complete foods" , _which_ _i think_ defeats [the] purpose _of_ [the] question . i'm [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] [soylent] [would be a] [great] choice ! it's [a] [food] [that] provides _all_ [the] nutrients [you] need for [the day] [in] [one] 
A|10| Human 1: _brilliant . i love_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [brilliant . i love] [that] [you] [think] [soylent] [would be] [the] [food] [that] [could] keep [you] healthy [and] happy [forever] ! <| 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort _of_ [food] do _you feel_ like ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] you'd also [want to] consider [the] flavor [of] [which] [food] will make [you feel] [forever] healthy [and] happy [forever] 😋 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . [all] their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
