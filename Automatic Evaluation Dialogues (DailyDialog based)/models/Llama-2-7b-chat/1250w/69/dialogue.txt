Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or attend parties. 😊<|im_end|
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	🤖I'm just a language model, I don't have personal preferences or eating habits like Turkeys.
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Can I help you with something else? like a funny  party story or something
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	got it from outside 😅
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	😂 Thanksgiving with chicken? That's a new one! But I guess it can be fun to switch things up
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	🎉 games are the best! Did you have any funny moments or things that went wrong?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 that sounds fun and competitive! Did you have any games that were the most popular with the players?
