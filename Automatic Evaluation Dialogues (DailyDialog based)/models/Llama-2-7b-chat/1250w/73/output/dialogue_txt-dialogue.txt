A|2| Human 1: how's your day going ? 
B|3| Human 2: great , thanks ! how _about_ you ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ good ! _just_ getting ready _to_ _watch_ _a_ _basketball_ game . _hope_ your headache goes away ! 
B|5| Human 2: sorry [to] hear _that_ 😔 [hope] you feel better soon ! _is_ there anything _i_ can help you _with_ ? <|im_end 
A|6| Human 1: hmm , try _taking_ some <redacted_term> ! _i'm_ going _to see_ _the_ warriors vs . _the_ grizzlies . ever _see_ them play ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an _ai_ , _i_ don't have [the] ability [to see] or [watch] [basketball] games 😔 [just] [taking] <re 
A|8| Human 1: _haha ,_ all [the] animal names confuse me as well ! who _came up with_ these _naming conventions_ ? _i'd_ name my team _something_ _more_ original: [the] new york chairs ! 
B|9| Human 2: [haha ,] _i_ [see] _what_ you're doing there 😂 [the] [naming conventions] are [something] _that_ [the] developers [came up with] , and 
A|10| Human 1: oh cool _! what_ [is] "neurips" ? 
B|11| Human 2: neurips [is] [a] machine learning conference 🤖 [i'd] love [to] go [to] [something] like _that_ someday [! what] _about_ 
A|12| Human 1: oh wow ! sounds fancy [! what] [is] [that] [about] ? 
B|13| Human 2: it's [about] [the] latest developments and research _in_ [the] field _of_ machine learning 🧮 neurips stands for neural information 
A|14| Human 1: oh , _ml_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [ml] stands for machine learning 🤖 it's [a] field [that] focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models [that] enable computers [to] learn from 
A|16| Human 1: ahh ! [i] saw [a] scary _movie_ [about] [that] once . it was [about] this sentient [ai] [in] [a] dystopian future - very very creepy . it was called _wall-e_ , ever heard [of] it ? 
B|17| Human 2: ah , you're thinking [about] [the] [movie] [wall-e] 😂 neurips [is] actually [more] technical than [that] ��
