B|3| Human 2: 😮 [superman !] * mind blown * may [i] ask [what] brings [you] _to_ _this_ chat today ? <|im_end| 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible ._ [you] _won't see_ _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: 🤔 _i'm_ afraid [i] [won't see] [you] as [you] are [invisible .] but [i] _can_ still chat with [you] , _and_ we 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri_ [and] _machine learning_ [to] do [this] . [i] [am] _not_ an _expert_ _on_ _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: 🤖 how [about] [this] ? i'll be [the] [machine learning] [expert] [and] [you] _can_ be [the] [fmri] [expert] . let's

B|9| Human 2: [the] [resolution] you're referring [to] _is_ [the] spatial [resolution] [that] [brain imaging] techniques [can] provide , which _is_ typically [on] [the] order of millimeters [to]

B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] [god] [that] created [me] [and] [fmri] [imaging] resolutions . [the] thing's [god] [can tell you] [about] [brain] [activity] . but 
A|12| Human 1: no , [i'm] bad at [science] . [what] [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most _important_ _thing_ _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science is] [important] [for society] , but it's [not] [the] only [thing that] matters . [the] [resolution] of [brain imaging] techniques [can tell you] [about] [brain] [activity] 
A|14| Human 1: does it make sense ?
