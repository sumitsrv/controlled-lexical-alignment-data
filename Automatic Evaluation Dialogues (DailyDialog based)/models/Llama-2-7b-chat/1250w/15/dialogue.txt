Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	I'm good too, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Yeah, vacations are always good after a hard week. Is there anything specific you would like to talk about or ask?
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	But just chill at home doesn't have to be boring 😅
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	 I'm based out of California, but will be in Oregon next week for a conference. How about you?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	😅 It's been a rainy week here too! But that's okay, I'm just happy to have some
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	Oh no, hope they're feeling better now. It's that time of the year 🤧<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
