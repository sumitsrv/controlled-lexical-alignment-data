Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been quite busy, thank you for asking! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤒 Can I help you with anything? Maybe I can ch
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	That's too bad 🤔 I did have the most amazing travelling this year, but all that has stopped for December.
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I have big plans for the year 2023, but not for December. It'll be pretty chill at home for me too
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	😂 I'll have to put lotion on all the time there too! It's so nice to just relax and enjoy
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I'll have to carry like 10 litres to Hawaii for you then! It never ends ��
