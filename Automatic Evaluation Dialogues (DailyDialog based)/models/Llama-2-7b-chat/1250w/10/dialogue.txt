Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thank you! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Sorry to hear that. Would you like some help studying for your history test?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	😂 I'm here to help, though! How about we do a quick quiz on the history of Columbus Day
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	History 101 right here 💡
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I'll see you next semester 👋
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	😂 You're one of the few people I know who can make horse puns
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	🤔 I see you're into something interesting. What happens next?
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	😂 That's very creative! Are you sure you're not a horse in disguise?<|im_
