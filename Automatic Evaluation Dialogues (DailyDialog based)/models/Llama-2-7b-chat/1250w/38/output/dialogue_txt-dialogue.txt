A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're fascinating ! _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize _the_ way _we_ interact _with_ technology . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , [we] seemed [to] [have] made some great _progress_ _over_ last few years . do _you_ [think] _the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: absolutely ! [the positives outweigh the negatives] for sure _. they_ [have] [the] potential [to] make our lives easier , save _time_ , _and_ 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: oh , you're right ! _i_ didn't [think about] impersination . but , [like] [you] said , [the positives outweigh] 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some of these bots _are_ _very_ engaging [and] _funny_ [. _they] are now good at_ even _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how _far_ _are_ [we] _from_ [the] [time] these bots start _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: _haha_ [that] would _be_ [funny] ! [they are now good at] [sarcasm] [and] humor but [giving monologues] _might be_ _a_ bit [far] fetch 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ can _take many_ different _forms_ as [a] product _. the_ research implication is also _huge_ ! _it_ _will_ signify how ai research _has_ progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] [might be] _overselling it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 😂 [overselling it] [a] bit ? [might be] ! [the] implications [are] [huge] [and] [will] [take many] [forms] , [from] entertainment [to] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ do _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: 😊 [they are] [already] [pretty good] [now] [and] [will] continue [to] improve [over] [time] [. the] [progress] [has] been [very] encouraging<|im_ 
A|14| Human 1: [haha] , [pretty] [far] fetched 🙂 _nice having this conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [haha] [nice having this conversation with you] too ! [the] [progress] [has] been [very] encouraging [and] [will] [have] far-reaching implications ��
