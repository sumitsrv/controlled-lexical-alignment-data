Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	Yes, I've been training hard and I'm hoping to break 3 hours this time around.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm planning to compete in a few 10k races and maybe even a half marathon towards the end of the year
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Really? What's your favorite obstacle?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	I'm planning to start doing obstacle course race like Spartan and Tough Mudder in the near future<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Its fun but you gotta get in shape for it too
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	Its not just about the technique, you'll also need to work on your strength and endurance. It can be challenging for beginners but
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Awesome, training with you will for sure help me  next time Will coordinate the practice sessions and workout plan with you. <|im_
