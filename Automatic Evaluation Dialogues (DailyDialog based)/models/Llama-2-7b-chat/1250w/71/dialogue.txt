Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	Oh no, sorry to hear that 😔 Is there something specifically that caused you so much pain today?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	I'm working on some project and months are passing but no progress is being made,  I've been shelved for like a week
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	I'm here for you and I care that you're going through a tough time 🤗 Would you like to talk about
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	I'm lost in how you're going 😅 Sorry for your day, and feel free to share<|im_end
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	What's keto 🤔 I'm pretty lost on how to ask you that
