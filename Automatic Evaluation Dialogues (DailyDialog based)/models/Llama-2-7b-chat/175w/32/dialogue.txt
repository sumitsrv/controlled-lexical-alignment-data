Human 1:	 That sounds like a perfect plan!
Human 2:	 How about we schedule a team meeting for tomorrow? That would give you time to settle in and get to know us better. What do
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	It's just the two of us for now, so it will be easier to have lunch sync. What do you think? <|im
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	Also, I'm the team lead, so I can help you with anything you need. 
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
