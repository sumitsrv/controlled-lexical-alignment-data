Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been quite good, thank you! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. 🤒 Take all the time you need to rest and recover
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have a budget for sick days 😂
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm just gonna chill with the family for most of December, we have some big plans for 2023 already though!
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	🌴 It's good to have a place like Hawaii to escape to. What are your big plans for 202
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I'm sure you have good reasons for needing so much lotion! It's important to be well-prep
