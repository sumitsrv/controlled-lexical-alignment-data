A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human _like_ chat _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ _they are_ _great_ ! _they_ _can_ help [you] _with_ _a_ lot _of_ things , [like] answering questions , providing information , _and_ _even_ chatizing _with you_ . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ made some [great] progress over last few years . do [you] _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] , but it's important [to] _be_ aware _of_ [the] potential downsides too . for example 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _haha ,_ yes , exactly ! _and_ privacy concerns , [the] _ai_ [bots] could potentially [have] access [to] _a_ lot _of_ personal _and_ sensitive information . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some [of] these _bots _are_ very_ engaging [and] funny . [they are] _now_ _good at_ [even] sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ far [are] we from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: _haha ,_ [that] would _be_ something ! but for [now] , _i [think_ the] most important thing _is_ [to] _be_ aware [of] _how ai_ [bots are] being 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it [can] take many different forms as [a] product _. the_ research implication [is] also huge ! it will signify [how ai] research has progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ [be] overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [that] [can] [be] [a] [good] [and] bad thing [. the] potential for [ai] [bots] [to] impersonate people , create fake news , or 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ already do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they [are] very] [good at] recognizing patterns [and] making connections [that] [might] not [be] immediately apparent [to] humans [. the] potential for [the] [auto-suggestions] [to] 
A|14| Human 1: [haha ,] pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation [with you] !
