Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	Indeed! Pumpkin pie is a classic holiday treat. Would you like to know some other popular holiday dishes?<|im_

Human 2:	You're right! Sharing is a big part of the holiday season. Are there any other holidays you would like to know about
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	Oh, you're in for a treat! Stuffing is a classic holiday side dish that's often associated with Thanksgiving
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	Ah, got it! So, electronics and clothes are the way to go for you during the holiday season. Is there anything else you would
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	That's great to hear! So, you're in the market for some new clothes and electronics?
