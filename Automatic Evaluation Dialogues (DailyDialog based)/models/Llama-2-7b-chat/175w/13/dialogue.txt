Human 2:	Marvel is great! I liked the Avengers and Black Panther. What do you think of the Fantastic Four movie?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	too scary?! 😱 did you watch the same Spiderman movie as me? �������
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I think the actor who played Spiderman in the new movies is really good looking! 😍 I've seen him in
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki is actually one of the most iconic villains in Marvel!  I recommend checking out the Thor movies, they are really good!
