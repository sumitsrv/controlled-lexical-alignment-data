Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't compose music. I help users like you with their YouTube video creation and optimization. <|
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	😂 I wish! I'm just a simple AI trained to assist and provide helpful responses. But thanks for the compliment
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	Nice! Playing guitar and learning to use music production software can be a lot of fun. What sort of music do you like to play?<
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	Haha nice! Yeah, guitar can be tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	Exactly! Once you learn the basic chords and can play them with ease, you'll be able to write and play your own music.
