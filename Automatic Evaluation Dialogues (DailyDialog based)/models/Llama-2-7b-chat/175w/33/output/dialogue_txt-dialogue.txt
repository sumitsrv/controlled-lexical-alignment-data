A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks _. i'm_ trying _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are _a_ [great] choice ! they're _a_ classic french pastry _that_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to make] _, but_ _with_ practice 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once _or_ twice _so_ far [, but] they haven't been flakey enough _. i'm_ trying [to] figure out why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: well , [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal experiences [or] [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ can certainly help [you] troubleshoot 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ _i_ might [have] found _the_ problem [. i'm] using bread flour instead [of] patissier's flour . can [you] tell _me_ 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] good idea . i'll _give_ _it_ [a] try next time . would [you] say [you] [have] [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal preferences [or] taste buds [, but] _i_ can [give] [you] _some_ tips on [how] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people [don't] _! but yeah ,_ [me] _too_ [, [i] think] i'd eat _pastries_ all [the] time if [i] could get away [with] _it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: 😋 [i'm] sure you'd be [great] at [it] [! but yeah ,] bread flour can [make] [the] [pastries] [too] dense 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , and caused all sorts [of] crazy _stomach upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: 😂 _that's_ [so] true [! but] [i think] [the] [stomach upsets] were from [the] <redacted_ter 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
