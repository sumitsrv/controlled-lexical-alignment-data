Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	hahaha, don't worry about it! Ramen is a great choice though 😋
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	ah, you're a Ramen connoisseur 😋 Dojo has some great options too! what are your favorite dishes
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	uh 😳, I'm just an AI and I don't have personal experiences or live near any physical location 
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	😲 soft-shell crabs? at a Ramen restaurant? that's definitely unique!<|im_end|
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
