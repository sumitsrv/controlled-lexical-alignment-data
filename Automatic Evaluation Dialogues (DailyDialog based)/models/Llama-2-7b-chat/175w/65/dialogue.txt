Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Oh no, sorry to hear that! That's annoying when you have a flat tire or something. Did you get the moped from
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	lol that's pretty funny, though the mechanic is probably not so laughing about it. Well, maybe you can use that time
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Nahh I don't drive, that's why I'm always here lol. But yeah you could pick me up and drop
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Yeah, they won 110-95 over the Pelicans. That Curry kid is something else. Did you see the game?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Yeah, they're on a roll. But hey, you never know what's gonna happen in the NBA. Did you hear about
