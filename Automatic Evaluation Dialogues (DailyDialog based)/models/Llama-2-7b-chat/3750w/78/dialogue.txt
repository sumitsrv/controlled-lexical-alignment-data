Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Oh, my apologies! Let me rephrase my question then. When did you first develop an interest in pastry chef work?<|
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm just good at guesswork! 😊 It was actually a lucky guess, haha. But that's cool
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I have a funny feeling that you're not actually psychic and instead are the cake chef! Perhaps you could tell me how to
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	😍 Chocolate cake and vanilla icing you say? I have a funny feeling that's the food equivalent
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	And for fun 😄 I'm a part-time cake chef and full time food psychic haha! How about you
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm a cake dance 🌹 and you can feel the cool breeze all around you! How about that for fun
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I see  What kind of cakes are your favorite to make?
