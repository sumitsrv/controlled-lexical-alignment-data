Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a great way to challenge yourself and get some exercise. How was your experience?<|im_
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	It's great that you're interested in the movie! What can I help you with?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Oh nice! I'm glad you liked the movie. What did you think of the plot twists?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hahaha nice! 😂 Yes, they can be fun but also scary when it's dark out! What movie was
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I'm originally from the southern hemisphere  But it was nice here when you are not going like winter and that can be very brief actually
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Australia's definitely nice and I can see why you like winter than  but too brief actually it should not take the day when you are going out
