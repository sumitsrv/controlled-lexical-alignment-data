Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I think there's some great fishing spots over there that you wouldn't find in the US though! What about Tokyo? Have you
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
