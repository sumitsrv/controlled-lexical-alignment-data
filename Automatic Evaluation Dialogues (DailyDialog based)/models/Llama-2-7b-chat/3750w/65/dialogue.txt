Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I see. Sorry to hear that. Would you like me to help you find the way back to work? Or perhaps recommend a moped repair shop
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	lol that's funny- diesel and moped  don't go well together. How are you feeling now?<|im
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Ehhh so-so lol the way work is 2 miles down the road and you'd think that they could fix this by now
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?  That's good, so they should finish work today and pick you up by l
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Haha that's good  you appreciate your faith- Warriors should finish work today and pick you up by the way but their record thus far
