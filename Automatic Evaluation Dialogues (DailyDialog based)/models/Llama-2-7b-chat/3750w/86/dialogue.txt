Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal plans or holidays, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have holidays or personal plans, so I will work 24/7 to help
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	Sorry to see you go; did something come up? Can I help with anything else?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	Uganda? That's not possible. I don't have any plans for Christmas. How come you're asking?<|im
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	That's really interesting. Where did you stay and was it safe? Did you have any interesting experiences?
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	I was using the organization's volunteer project and staying with local families. They have projects all over Uganda and Africa. </s>
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	IJGD and the local partners they work with have projects all over Africa, including Uganda. It's great that you volunteered
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
