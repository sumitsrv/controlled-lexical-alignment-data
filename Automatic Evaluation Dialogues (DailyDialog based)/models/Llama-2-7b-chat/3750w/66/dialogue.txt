Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or any personal experiences, so I can't run marathons
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have any physical events or sporting activities planned
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 and you're planning any triathlons in the coming months?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	fun and challenging obstacle race like Spartan Race? What's your favorite obstacle?
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	It's one of the most fun and challenging obstacle race like Spartan Race. Its not overly difficult but you will see your limits
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's about pushing you to your limits and not the amount you workout before
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 Awesome! Will you join with me for training sessions next time? Its always fun and challenging workout with other people<|im_
