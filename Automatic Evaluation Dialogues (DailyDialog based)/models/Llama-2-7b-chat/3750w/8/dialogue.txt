Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been productive, thanks for asking! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell 🤧 Is there anything I can do to help?<|
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I see 😔 Well, you'll have the chance to rest and recharge your batteries for the year ahead <|im
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'll have to take the year with 1 sick week 😔 big plans for you?
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Oh 😂 I'm glad you like it there! It's definitely a beautiful place, but lotion-free is definitely
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I'm the same way! It's like, I love going to the beach, but the lotion for all
