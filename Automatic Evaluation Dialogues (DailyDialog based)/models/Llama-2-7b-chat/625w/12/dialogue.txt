Human 1:	 Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....
Human 2:	How's the weather there during summer?
Human 1:	 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!
Human 2:	I've been there too! It's a great city with a lot of history and culture
Human 1:	 Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
Human 2:	I've been to the onsen and market as well! It's definitely a unique experience
Human 1:	 The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!
Human 2:	It's great for kids and adults alike! I also went on the Disney land parachute ride which was so much fun!
Human 1:	 I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha
Human 2:	I'm sure you had a great time at Disney Land and the robot fighting show! It can be a really unique experience to watch giant robots
