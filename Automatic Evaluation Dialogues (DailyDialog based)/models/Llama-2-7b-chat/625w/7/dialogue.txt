Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	Avatar is a good movie, but I'm a bit biased towards sci-fi movies. My favorite is Interstellar. what
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	Wow, that's interesting! I didn't know Avatar had such a deep meaning behind it. I'll have to watch it
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I like reading books and exploring new places. what about you?
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
