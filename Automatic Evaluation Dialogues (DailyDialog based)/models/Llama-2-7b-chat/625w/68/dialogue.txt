Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course, I'd be happy to help you understand some concepts! Can you please provide me with more details about the concepts you're interested
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	Of course! I'm available now. We can have a video call to discuss the concepts you're not sure about. Just let me know
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand some concepts for the test. Can you please provide me with more details about the topics you'
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 You're right. I think we have the time to cover everything. But its always best to over prepare for exams, you know?
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	Same here! You're not the only one though. Many students from my class have also been feeling very stressed out with these November exams
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	Thats cool. You should definitely give it a shot. Its a great way to reinforce what you've learned<|im_end|
