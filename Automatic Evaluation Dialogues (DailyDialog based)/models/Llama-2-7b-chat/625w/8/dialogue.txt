Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been good, thank you! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell 🤒 Is there anything I can do to help?<|
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	That's too bad 😕 I did have a lot of fun travelling this year though. So many new experiences and memories
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I have plans for 2023 too. I would love to travel more this year but I'll also make sure to take it easy
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	😂 Yes, it's definitely a good place for humidity-sensitive skin! I'll have to add Hawai
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I can imagine! It's important to take care of yourself and your skin while travelling. Do you have any recommend
