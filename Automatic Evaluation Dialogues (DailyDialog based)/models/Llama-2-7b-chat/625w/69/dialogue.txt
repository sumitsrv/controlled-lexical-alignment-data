Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or attend parties. How can I help you today?<|im_
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	I apologize, but I don't have a Turkey or any other physical party to attend. I'm just an AI designed to assist
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Is there anything else you would like to chat about or ask? I'm here to help
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	Haha, you got me there! I don't have a home or a stomach to cook anything. But I'm here to
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Ah, got it! Thanksgiving with chicken sounds like a great alternative. Chicken is always a crowd pleaser 😊
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Oh, fun games you say? Did you have any turkey shootouts 😂?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	😂 that sounds like a lot of fun! Pictionary and office tennis are great games for any party, especially Thanksgiving
