Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Horse racing is a exciting sport. Did you know that AI is also being used in horse racing to improve performance
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	Ah, I see! It's great that you're able to reconnect with friends and have some fun. 😊 How
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences haha, but I can definitely provide some information about deep sea fishing
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm glad you got super sea sick 😂 Have fun with deep sea fishing! It can be a great experience, but
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	It's nice to hear that you're enjoying deep sea fishing! It can be a great way to relax and connect with nature.
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is a great city! I'd love to visit there someday. Have you been there before?
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	You're welcome! I think there are a lot of great places to visit, but the top of my list is Tokyo. Have you been there
