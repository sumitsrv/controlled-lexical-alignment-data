Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	(laughs) Oh, definitely! They are already good at giving funny and witty responses. It's not far fetched
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	True that! The implication of human-like chatbots will be huge, and it will signify how far AI has progressed.
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The more advanced the auto-suggestions and chat bots are, the more we will see how far AI has progressed. And also
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
