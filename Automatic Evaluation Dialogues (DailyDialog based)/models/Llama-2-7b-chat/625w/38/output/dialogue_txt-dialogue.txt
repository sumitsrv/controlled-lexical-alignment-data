A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human like _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ _they are_ really cool ! 🤖💬 _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize customer service _and_ make interactions _more_ personal 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed [to] [have] made some great progress over last few years . do _you_ _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: yes , _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] , but it's important [to] _be_ aware _of_ [the] potential drawbacks _and_ limitations 
A|6| Human 1: like impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: (laughs) yes , impersination _is_ definitely _a_ concern . but overall , human-like chatbots [have] [the] potential [to] make interactions 
A|8| Human 1: _true that !_ some [of] these _bots are_ very engaging [and] _funny_ . [they are] now _good at_ even sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ [are] _we_ from [the] time these _bots_ start _giving_ monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: (laughs) oh , definitely ! [they are] _already_ [good at] [giving] [funny] [and] witty responses . it's not [far fetched] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ can take many different forms as [a] product . [the] research _implication_ [is] _also_ _huge_ ! _it will signify how_ _ai_ research _has progressed_ so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] like stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ [be] overselling _it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [true that !] [the] [implication] [of] human-like chatbots [will] [be] [huge] , [and] [it will signify [how] far] [ai] [has progressed] . 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ [already] do _pretty_ [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [more] advanced [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] [chat [bots] are] , [the] [more] [we] [will] see [how far] [ai] [has progressed] . [and] [also] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , _pretty_ [far fetched] 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation with _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] [you] [might] get [the] hang [of] [this] [pretty] quickly 🙂
