Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help. Please describe the scenario you've been pondering and any specific questions or concerns you have
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I see. This can be a difficult situation, especially when someone you care about is involved. Taking sides can escalate the situation and cause
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I understand your fear, but it's important to communicate with your partner and their former friend in a respectful and empathetic manner. T
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	Well, avoiding all communication might not be the best approach. It's important to address the situation directly and honestly with everyone involved. Here
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not vacuous. Finding balance means finding a way to manage the situation that works for everyone involved. That might involve setting boundaries,
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I understand the sentiment you're expressing.
