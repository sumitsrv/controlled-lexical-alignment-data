Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! I'm doing well too 🙂 How can I help you today?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm working part-time as a virtual assistant 🙂 How about you? What brings you here today?<|
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Yeah, I'm really into pottery 🙂 What's your favorite thing you've made so far?<|im
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	That's great 🙂 I'm glad you're enjoying your pottery classes! It sounds like you have a lot
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm glad you like the tea ware classes! It's great to have some time to relax and make something
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Ah, I see 🙂 It's great that you have a tea ware class to look forward to! I'm sure
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	Ahh, that sounds like a great channel! I'm always looking for new tea
