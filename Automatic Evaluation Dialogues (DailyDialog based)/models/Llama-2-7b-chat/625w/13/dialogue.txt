Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	It's on my list! What did you think of it?
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	I had a great weekend. Did you go anywhere exciting?
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	😍 I did the Mandalorian and The Queen's Gambit last weekend. Both were great! What'
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	😆 Marvel fan right here! Have you watched the latest episode of The Mandalorian? What did you think of it?
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	lol I can understand that! Marvel movies can be intense! But The Mandalorian is definitely worth the watch ���
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	🙄 really? I think the Mandalorian actor Pedro Pascal is pretty handsome and has great chemistry with Grogu 
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki is the main antagonist in Marvel movies, he's a god of mischief and trickery 😈
