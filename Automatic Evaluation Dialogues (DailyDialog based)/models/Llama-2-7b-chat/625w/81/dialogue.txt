Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	Awesome! That sounds like a lot of fun. 😃 How was the snow?
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	😂 Oh no, that sounds like a scary experience! But glad to hear that you got better after it. Skiing can
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	🤖 I'm just an AI, I don't know any French or any other human language. I can only communicate
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Did you enjoy your stay in Montreal? </s>.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I've heard the Olympics can be really fun to attend but also very crowded and expensive 
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I've always wanted to attend the Olympics but I think the odds of me actually making it are slim 
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 😅 I don't think that's a good idea <REDACTED_TER
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
