Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing a headache. Is there anything I can do to help?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?

Human 2:	Haha, I see what you're saying! The naming conventions can be a bit confusing. But hey, at least we all have
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?

Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	🤖 Yep! I'm all about the machine learning 
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	😅 Ahh, no that's more like the dystopian future movie I was talking about! ���
