Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm going well, thank you. How can I help you today?</|im_end|> </s>suggestion:
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal feelings or weekend plans, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 I'm looking forward to the weekend myself. I'm going to watch the game with my family and friends. <|im_
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	😂 Yeah, I can imagine! Hokey is really popular in Japan, and I've heard the live performances are amazing
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	👏🏼 training hard! You'll do great! I might have to stick to the couch this weekend
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	You're being pretty brave if you ask me! 😂 I still have a lot to learn and might just stick to training myself
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	😂 I'm pretty sure that will give you the win haha! Do you have any fun jiu jitsu stories
