Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How about you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	Oh, I'm good now, thanks! I think it was just from looking at my computer screen for too long. How about you?<
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	I'm going to see them play the <REDACTED_TERM> today! Hope they win!<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	Haha, I'm sure your team name would be more original! 😂 
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	Sounds cool! I'm more into something with NeurIPS  
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	Sounds cool! I'm more into something with NeurIPS  
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	NeurIPS is the biggest machine learning conference in the world.  
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Ahh, that's cool! I've heard about Wall-e too! What was creepy about it?  <|im
