B|5| Human 2: ah , _i'm_ sure [you're] [going] [to] enjoy [the holidays] [with] [your] [healthy] [and] [relax] [well] [. there's definitely] nothing [better] 
A|6| Human 1: [definitely] ! [i] know [a] lot of _folks_ _travel _for_ the holidays_ [, but _i'm] happy_ [to] _stay_ _home myself_ !

[i] remember having real [christmas] _trees_ from childhood [, but] these days [with] _climate_ change , [i] think _not_ chopping down [a] [tree] just [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in [a] month _is_ [the] _more responsible_ thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [yes] , [that's] [very] true ! [now i] understand [the] [pun] [better .] [buying] [eco-friendly] [trees] [is] [more responsible] [and] [climate] change-

B|17| Human 2: [target] [has] [some] [good deals] [but] [have] [you] seen [the] prices [for] [like] [and] artificial [trees] they're [not] [that] [eco-friendly] as [they] 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i] hope [you] find [a] nice [tree] .
