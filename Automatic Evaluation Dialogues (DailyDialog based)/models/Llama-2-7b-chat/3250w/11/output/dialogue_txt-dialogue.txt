A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: sure ! _what_ would [you] _like_ _to_ know about flowers ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working _on_ _a_ _theory _._ why_ does _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: 😊 [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ beauty _and_ spiritual transformation in many cultures _. it's_ known for its ability

A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ someone [what] _their_ favourite [flower is] . pretty much [like] [what] we _just_ did . does _that_ make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] [and] [gerbera] [are] both beautiful flowers [that] [have] [their] own unique personalities [. it's] interesting [to] [think that] [people] may 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: _talk_ with [the] person _some_ _more_ , [and] _ask them_ _some_ _more questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] _maybe_ two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and] what's [the] point [of] [that] [step] 2 ? [it] [just] seems [like] [more questions] [and] [maybe] [some] small [talk] [. why] [not] [just] [ask them] [their]
