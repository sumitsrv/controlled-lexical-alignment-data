A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: [hi] 
A|2| Human 1: okay ... so _i_ need _someone_ _to help_ _me_ _though_ _a_ _scenario_ _i've been_ pondering . 
B|3| Human 2: of course , i'd _be_ happy [to help] ! please go ahead and share your [scenario] _with_ [me] . 
A|4| Human 1: my partner's former friend invited [me] _for_ lunch (they _are_ _not_ _in_ good books _right_ now) . but during their friendship _i_ _formed_ _an_ independent _bond with_ _the_ _other_ person because we _all_ used [to] hang out _a_ lot . now _i_ _feel_ like _i_ _have_ [to] take sides . 
B|5| Human 2: [i] see _. it_ can _be_ difficult when [someone] you've [formed] [a] [bond with] _is_ involved [in] [a] difficult situation [with] [someone] else , especially if _they_ [are] 
A|6| Human 1: [i] hope [they] do . getting older already means smaller circles [. it] sucks [to] lose _friends_ _for_ arbitrary reasons _. that's_ good advice _though ._ [i] fear raising _the_ issue _might_ sound like treason . lol . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] understand how you [feel] _. it's_ [not] _always_ easy [to] navigate difficult situations [with] [friends] , especially when [they] [are] involved [in] conflicts [with] [other] _people_ . 
A|8| Human 1: aka _avoiding_ _all_ texts from _everyone_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i'm_ [not] sure [avoiding] [everyone] _is_ [the] best approach [though [.] it] [might] _be_ helpful [to] [have] [an] open and honest conversation [with] [all] parties involved 
A|10| Human 1: [people] [always] _say_ _to find_ _a balance_ but never _say_ _what_ _the balance_ [is] [. it's] used so often _that_ [it's] vacuous . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [not] [always] easy [to find] [the balance] [though [.] that's] [what] [i've been] trying [to] [say] [all] day<|im_end 
A|12| Human 1: lol . _i'm finna_ [be] _single_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm finna] [single] too [it] [might] [help] [to] [have] [a balance] [that] works [for] [everyone] and [find] [the] [right] communication method [for] [all] parties<|im
