Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course, I'd be happy to help! Please go ahead and share your scenario with me.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I see. It can be difficult when someone you've formed a bond with is involved in a difficult situation with someone else, especially if they are
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I understand how you feel. It's not always easy to navigate difficult situations with friends, especially when they are involved in conflicts with other people.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure avoiding everyone is the best approach though. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with all parties involved
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not always easy to find the balance though. That's what I've been trying to say all day<|im_end
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm finna single too It might help to have a balance that works for everyone and find the right communication method for all parties<|im
