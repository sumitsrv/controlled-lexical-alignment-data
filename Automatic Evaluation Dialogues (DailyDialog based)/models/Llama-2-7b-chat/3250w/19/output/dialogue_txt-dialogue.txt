B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! what _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😂 [superman] [you] say ? well _, i'm_ [the] assistant that's here _to_ help [you] with any questions or tasks [you] 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: 😂 you're [invisible] [you] say ? well , [i] [see] [you] very clearly ! *wink wink*<|im_ 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust fmri _and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ _. i_ [am] _not_ _an_ _expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: 😅 that's perfectly fine ! _i'm_ just [an] ai [and machine learning] _is_ [the] [expert] [for] [this] task [. i] won 
A|8| Human 1: _the _brain_ imaging_ _thing that can tell you_ a brain's _activity_ at a _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: that's [pretty] cool ! [can] [you] [tell] [me] more [about] [brain imaging] [and machine learning] ? 🤔<|im_end| 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe _in_ _science_ ! _science is_ my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] [thing that can tell you] [about] [brain imaging] [and machine learning] , [not] [god] 😅 . but [for] real , f 
A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] _it_ [the] most _important_ [thing] _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [about] [the brain] [and] how [it] works , including [imaging] techniques [that can] [see] [activity] [in] [the brain] 🧬 . but 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: of course ! 🙂 [science] [can] [make sense] of [the brain] [and] how [it] works , what's [important] [for society] , [and] lots of
