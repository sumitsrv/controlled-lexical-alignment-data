Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Oh great! *pauses*  What game did you play?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.

Human 2:	 That's very funny. I think it sounds like cage match would be really fun and tiring for you though! It involves hitting
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
