Human 2:	You have tournament coming up? Are you going to spar or compete? How's your training going?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.

Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
