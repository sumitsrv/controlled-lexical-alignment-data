Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-time weather data, but I can tell you that the weather
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or emotions like humans do, but I can understand that rain
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	that's too bad... rain is much needed though
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	Haha, that's so true!  I think the weather can make days gloomy too much for them to survive<|im_
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 that's interesting... have they water rations there too?
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	Yeah, the weather here was interesting this morning too  lol... there's that drought but you don't see water rationing
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
