Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	Today has been interesting, but I can't reveal any details about our top-secret projects. 😄 Would you
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	😱 roller coasters are cool! do you like that rush of adrenaline and the view from the top
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Kingda Ka 😮 that's tall and fast! how was the view from the top?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not really but I'm all about trying new experiences 😄 how about you?
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	😂 that's the spirit! sometimes you just need to trust the engineering and scream all the way down haha<|
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	😂 I'm sure the adrenaline rush was fun but glad it's done now haha what did you
