Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! breakfast is a great way to start the day with energy and positivity.  But just so you know,
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I see 😅 eggs and hash browns can definitely be a tasty breakfast option, but you're right that they may
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I would eat  pizza forever and ever! the cheese, the crusts, you could just only had one food that's great
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	😂 Yeah I think that would be a drawback of only eat one food forever! That's what nutrition and variety
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so 😊 So would only eat one food forever be a good or bad thing? what are your thoughts
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I want food that's a feel-good like ice cream and one you could eat forever! That would be the only drawback other
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
