B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ delicious _breakfast_ , which always sets _the day_ up _right_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that_ ! [breakfast] _is_ [a] [great] _way_ _to_ start [the day] with energy _and_ positivity . but [just] _so_ _you_ know , 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ _had_ _eggs and hash browns_ . [way] less healthier than _your_ apple , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: [i] see 😅 [eggs and hash browns] can definitely _be a_ tasty [breakfast] option , but you're [right] _that_ _they_ may 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's_ true . if _you could_ _only eat one food forever_ , _what_ _would_ it [be] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [would] [eat] pizza [forever] [and] ever ! [the] cheese , [the] crusts , [you could] [just] [only] [had] [one food] [that's] [great] 
A|8| Human 1: _yeah_ , turning orange _would be a drawback_ _! that_ turns my mind [to] _nutrition_ [so] [i] suddenly _want_ [to] say soylent _or_ [one] _of_ those _other_ "complete foods" , which _i think_ defeats [the] purpose _of_ [the] question . [i'm] in [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: 😂 [yeah] [i think] [that] [would be a drawback] [of] [only eat one food forever] ! [that's] [what] [nutrition] [and] variety 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] [think] [so] 😊 [so] [would] [only eat one food forever] [be a] good [or] bad thing ? [what] _are_ [your] thoughts 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . [what] sort [of] [food] do [you] feel _like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [want] [food] [that's] [a] feel-good [like] ice cream [and] [one] [you could] [eat] [forever] [! that] [would be] [the] [only] [drawback] [other] 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , [they] have franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
