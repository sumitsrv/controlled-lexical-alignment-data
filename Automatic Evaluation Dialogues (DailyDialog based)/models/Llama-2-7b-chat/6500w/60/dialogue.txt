Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?</|im_end|> </s></s>{ "@context
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Rock climbing can be a wonderful way to challenge yourself and stay active. How was your experience?<|im
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	What's your favorite movie genre?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahaha yes they can be very good that way! What's your favorite twists and turns movie?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	😅 Yes it can be scary but also very fun and rewarding when you're out there pushing yourself! How about you
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I see 🙂 winter can be nice but it's not the same when you're all bundled up and can't
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Ahh I see 🤔 that can definitely be scary too! Where are you from originally?
