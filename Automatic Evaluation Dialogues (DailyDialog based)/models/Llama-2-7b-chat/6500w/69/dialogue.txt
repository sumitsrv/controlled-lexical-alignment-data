Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?

Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 I'm a large language model, I don't have personal preferences or relationships with Turkeys or any other living being. My purpose
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	How can I help you today? Is there a specific question or topic you'd like to chat about?<|im<|im_end
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 Haha you got me! I'm just a language model, I don't cook or eat anything, so I did neither haha
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	How are you with chicken? 🐔
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	😅 funny you should mention games! Did you have any turkey-themed games or activities? Like a Turkey Trot
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	that sounds fun 😂 and you have the pads with writing paper are rackets? Did players take a lot of balls from bucket
