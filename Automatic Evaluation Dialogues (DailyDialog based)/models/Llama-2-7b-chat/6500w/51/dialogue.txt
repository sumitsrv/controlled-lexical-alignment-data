Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴🏇️ Did you have a favorite horse or race?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's great to hear that you had some quality time with friends! How long since you last saw each other?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm great, but fishing wouldn't be part of that 😅 How about some good food? Ever tried seafo
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?

Human 2:	I'm actually going with some friends  It's been great catching up with you!
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo 😍 I'd love to visit there some day! What about you? Have any fun weekend plans yourself?<|
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
