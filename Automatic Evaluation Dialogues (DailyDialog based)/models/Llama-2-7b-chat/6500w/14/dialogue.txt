Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 cool that's great! did you enjoy it?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	actually was the first roller coaster that went 456 feet tall and reachs a top speed of 128 mph.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not the adrenaline junkie type but that was actually my first roller coaster and I went all by myself 
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	I'm actually not the roller coaster type haha but I understand why people would enjoy that adrenaline rush<|im
