A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying_ _to_ learn how _to_ make _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! 🥐 they're definitely _a_ [great] make-at-home treat . _i_ can help _you_ _with_ _that_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once or twice so far , _but they_ _haven't_ _been_ _flakey_ _enough_ . _i'm_ _trying_ _to_ figure _out_ why . _what kind of_ _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai [but] _i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] 😅 [but] _i_ can definitely help [you] [out] _with_ your croiss 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] [trying] [out] different recipes [but they] _all_ [have] [flakey] layers 🥺 what's your [thought] on _that_ ? do 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] _good_ idea . i'll _give_ it [a] _try_ next _time_ . _would you say_ _you have_ [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [good] 😊 [what kind of] [sweet tooth] [you have] ? [would you say] [that] [croissants] [give] [you] [enough] butter 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , [i] think i'd eat _pastries_ [all] _the_ _time_ if [i] could _get_ away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ [the] most butter-tastic [good] [to] [have you] [try] [with] [pastries] [that] [don't] [get] [too] flaky [but they] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time i paid attention to that sort of stuff_ _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ _being_ marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and caused all sorts of_ _crazy stomach upsets ._ 
B|13| Human 2: [the] market [was] [the last time i paid attention to that sort of stuff] [when] [and caused all sorts of] [being] [crazy stomach upsets .] 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
