Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	That sounds like a great way to meet new people! Have you been to any exciting places recently?
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	Wow, 25 is a lot! Which one was your favorite?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	Australia was one of the best.  The people are friendly and the culture is different from what I'm used to. I loved trying new food
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 I'm glad people are usually from different places and it's fascinating what matters to them- but it would also be really cool
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 The interactions you've had are really short and it would be fascinating to learn more about them- what matters to them<|im
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	That's interesting- what was it you found spooky about it? The short interactions and the fascinating people?<|im_
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	you're really curious about everything people are saying- what matters to them  and treasure hunting interesting? That's great!<|im
