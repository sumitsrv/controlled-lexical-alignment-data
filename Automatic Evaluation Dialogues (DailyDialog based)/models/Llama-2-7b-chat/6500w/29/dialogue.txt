Human 2:	 I'm full time sewing class sounds great. What you working on at the moment? Are your classes from college?<|im_
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	I'm working on some pottery that's from the 1950s It was part of my great aunts tea set
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
