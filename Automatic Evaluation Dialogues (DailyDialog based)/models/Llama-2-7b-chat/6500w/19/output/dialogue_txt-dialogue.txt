A|6| Human 1: _i would_ rather _trust fmri and machine learning to_ do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . _sorry for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: you're welcome 🙂 [and] [that] [you] [for] [trust fmri and machine learning to] [not] [see me] [this] time ��� 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain_ _imaging_ _thing _that_ _can_ tell you_ _a_ _brain's activity_ at _a_ pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: _what can_ [you] [tell] [about] [the] [brain's activity] [that] [would] [not] [see me] [this] time ? 🤔 [sorry for] _my_ curiousity [thing]

B|11| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [about] [brain] [activity] [and] [imaging] technology that's [for] sure , but [the] [thing that] [see] [this] time [is] [not] [a] [god] , 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ bad at [science] . [what _can] science_ do ? [is] it [the] most _important_ [thing] _for society ?_
