B|5| Human 2: 😆 that's [great] ! [it's] always [amazing] when [you] win [, but] [taking credit for it] is [just] _as_ important !

B|7| Human 2: [haha] that's [very] [kind of] [you] [but] [i guess] [i just won a] [game] [of] [pingpong] against myself . [it] was quite the challenge 
A|8| Human 1: _what's_ _racquetball_ _like_ ? _from context clues_ , _i'm guessing that_ _it involves hitting a ball with_ [a] _racquet_
