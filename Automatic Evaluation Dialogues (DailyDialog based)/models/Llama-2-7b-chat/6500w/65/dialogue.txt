Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that! 😔 Does the shop have a way to fixed your moped and when might you be
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	😂 Well, that's definitely a moped-related mishap! Don't worry, mechanics usually know what
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Ehhh... I don't drive lol  I work at the moped shop now so that wasn't an option today and<
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
