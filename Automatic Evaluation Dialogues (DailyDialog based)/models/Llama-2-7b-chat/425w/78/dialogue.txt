Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Oh, my apologies! I misunderstood. Can you tell me more about your interests and hobbies?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	Haha, I'm just a good listener! So, how did you get into cake decorating?
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?<|
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	Oh, that's great! I'm a big fan of cake too! Have you ever tried making your own decorations? It can
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	haha work is a food that I enjoy eating too, the leftovers are the best part haha! What's your favorite
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	🤯 that's so cool! I'm just a simple dance bot, I don't have personal experiences like that 
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	🤔 I'm a very curious bot, can you tell me more about the work you do? Maybe there are some cakes
