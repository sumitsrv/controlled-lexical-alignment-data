Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	Oh, that's perfectly fine! Just relaxing at home can be great too. Do you have any plans for the day?<|im
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and do not have a physical location or days off. I'm here to help you 24/
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	San Francisco is quite far from my location, but I hope you're enjoying your time there! It's a great city with a lot
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
