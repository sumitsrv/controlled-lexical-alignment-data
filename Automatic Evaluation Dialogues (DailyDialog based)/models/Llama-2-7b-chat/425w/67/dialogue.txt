Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	Oh, wow! That's quite an adventure. Are you nervous?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Seville is such a beautiful city. Have you tried the local cuisine?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Not a problem! I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. Just let me know what's on your mind
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm afraid I'm a little too cautious for that kind of thing. Although I do enjoy hiking and rock climbing
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Haha you're something else! I think I'll stick to hiking and climbing for now. Thanks for the advice<|
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	That's great! It's definitely important to start with beginner-friendly sports and work your way up. And hey, baby steps
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
