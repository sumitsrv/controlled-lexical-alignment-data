A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: do _you_ _believe in miracles_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: lol . no . _i_ know _too_ _many_ _people_ whose _lives suck_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i] see . _well ,_ sometimes people's [lives suck] for [many] reasons , but _miracles_ _can_ still happen even _in_ _the_ worst _of_ times . 
A|4| Human 1: _it's_ _too_ [many] [of] them out there . [you] help _who_ _you can_ . regardless , [i] wouldn't say [i] [believe in miracles] - [well ,] if [i] _got_ promoted next cycle [i] might _change_ my mind . 
B|5| Human 2: [it's] understandable _to_ feel that way , but [miracles] [can] come [in] [many] forms _, not_ just [in] _the_ grand _and_ dramatic sense . 
A|6| Human 1: right now [, not] much _. it's_ unclear . career is _a_ _good_ fallback _because you get_ told _what_ _good_ means _and you_ act accordingly . [i] haven't _gone through the_ process [of] shaping my _values_ . _what_ _about_ [you] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [it's] [good] that [you] _have_ [a] clear idea [of] [what] [you] want . but , sometimes , [the] [values] [and] beliefs _we_ hold dear [can] [change] [too] 
A|8| Human 1: [we] didn't [have] _electricity_ growing up . explains [a] lot . lol . 
B|9| Human 2: what's [electricity] [got] _to_ do _with_ [miracles] [and] [values] ? 
A|10| Human 1: _it makes_ _it_ _easier_ [to] empathise [with] _people who_ grew up lacking _things_ . [not] sure _it makes_ me empathise [with] _people_ [in] general . where did [you] grow up ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [easier] [because you get] [things] from [people who] [have] [gone through the] same thing . [it makes] for better communication [and] understanding<|im_ 
A|12| Human 1: _all their money_ ? by [a] person or an organisation ? 
B|13| Human 2: [not] necessarily [all their money] [. it's] more [about] [the] [people who] [have] [gone through] [things] that [you can] relate [too] . [and you] are [in] [a]
