Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Oh no, Sorry to hear that!  How's your day going now?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	lol. The shop owner says that the diesel is way more expensive than gas and he's trying to figure out why my moped broke
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 The mechanic said that they'll try to finish the work as soon as possible and you can pick me up by way of using a tax
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Warriors game? Oh you're talking about the moped issue lol. No I don't have time for that today, work has
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	That's good to hear that they're hard to refute their record! Would you like me to pick up your moped when the work
