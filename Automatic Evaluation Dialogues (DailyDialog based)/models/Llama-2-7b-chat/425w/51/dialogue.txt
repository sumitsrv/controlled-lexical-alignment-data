Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Oh, good! 🐴 Horses are so majestic and beautiful. Did you learn anything new about them today?<|
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	Aha, I see! 😅 It's great that you're enjoying yourself with friends! How long had you been
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm going deep sea fishing soon, actually! 🏞️ How are you enjoying horse racing? Have you been to
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Yeah, its super fun but you gotta be prepared for any weather condition 🌊 What's your favorite fishing spot?<
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo 🌟 I'd love to visit there someday! What do you think about the food over there? Do you prefer
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
