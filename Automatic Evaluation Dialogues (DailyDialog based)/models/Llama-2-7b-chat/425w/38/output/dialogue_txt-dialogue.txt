A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ _they are_ really cool ! _they_ _can_ help _with_ answering questions _and_ providing information , _and_ _they_ _can_ _also_ _be_ _a_ lot _of_ fun _to_ talk _to_ . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have_ made _some_ _great_ progress _over_ last few years . do _you_ _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] in terms _of_ [chat bots] [like] myself _. they_ _can_ _be_ _very_ useful _and_ helpful , _and_ _they_ 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination ?_ though _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: what's [impersorsination ?] 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! _some_ [of] _these bots_ [are] [very] engaging [and] funny [. [they] are] _now_ _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ _far_ [are] we from [the] _time_ _these bots_ _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: (laughs) _i think_ [that] day _is_ still [far] off , but it's fun [to] imagine [the] possibilities ! maybe [some] [bots] _will_ [start] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] [also] huge ! _it will_ signify _how_ _ai research_ has progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling _it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] future [of] chatbots [and] [ai research] [is] [very] exciting . [it will] [be] interesting [to] see [how] [these bots] evolve [over] [time] [and] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions _already_ do _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: 😉</s>sarcasm detection [and] [the current] capabilities [are] [already] [pretty good] . [like] [you] said , [even] [now] [bots] [can] [be] fun 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation _with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: 😀 indeed ! it's always fun chatting [with you] too . [have] [a] [great] day !
