Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Yes, they are giving out some delicious snacks and drinks. Here are the details:
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Oh, I see! 😊 Yeah, the jacket is definitely a good choice. But they are also giving out some other fun
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can understand how cold weather can be challenging for some people
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	It's nice that you don't get extreme cold weather there! 😊 Do you live in a warm place?<|
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😅 Yeah, New York City can be quite cold, especially during the winter months. But there are also plenty of indoor activities
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	😂 Oh no, last time they ran out? What happened?
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	There's one in the floor and you can walk there too 😅
