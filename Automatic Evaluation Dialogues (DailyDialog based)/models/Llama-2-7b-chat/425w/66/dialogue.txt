Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	Yes, I've been working on my endurance, have you?
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I am planning to participate in the marathon coming up in three months time. Would you like to join me?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	That sounds like fun! I'd be happy to join you and the marathon. It's always great to have a race buddy.
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Its always fun and challenging, but if you're not prepared, it can be frustrating too. It's important to train properly
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Sure, that sounds like fun! When is the marathon and where is it held?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	Cool! 1-2 months is a good time frame for training for the obstacle course marathon. It's important to practice regularly
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	👍 Will coordinate with you next time for practice. It's good to have a training ground. What's the best way
