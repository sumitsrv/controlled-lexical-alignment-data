A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are _a_ [great] choice ! they're _a_ classic french pastry _that_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to make] _, but_ _with_ practice 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ _once_ _or_ twice so far [, but] they haven't been _flakey enough_ . _i'm_ trying _to figure out why_ . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal experiences [or] [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ can definitely help [you] [out] _with_ your croiss 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ you'll [have] [to figure out why] they're _not_ [flakey enough] [once] [you] [make] [them] again . there _could_ be several reasons [, but] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] _is_ [a] good idea . i'll _give_ _it_ [a] _try_ next time . would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal preferences [or] tooths [, but] _i_ can [give] [you] _some_ tips on [how] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people [don't] ! [but] yeah , me _too_ [, [i] think] _i'd_ _eat_ _pastries_ _all the_ time if [i] [could] get away [with] _it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [the] problem [with] [croissants] [is] [that] they're [too] buttery _and_ [sweet] for [some] people's taste buds . [but] don' 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort _of_ stuff _was_ when _<redacted_term>_ _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts _of_ crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'd] [try] [to] [<redacted_term>] [and] [eat] [all the] [pastries] [you] [could] [think] [of] . [it] [was] [a] marketing 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
