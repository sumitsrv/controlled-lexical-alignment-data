Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Oh, my apologies!  Who are you actually?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI that was trained on a wide variety of conversations and topics, including pastry chef and cake chef �
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I actually have a cake-themed food diary that you're psychic-ly guessed the cover of haha <|
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and have no personal preferences or cake-eating ability, but I can tell you that the best
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm a machine that can work for 24 hours a day and not get the munchies haha What about you?<|
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 I can dance a style that makes you feel the cake-themed food diary's magic and enjoy all the flavors without e
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I'm sure the cakes are very nice! What kind of dance style do you like to do for fun? <|im_end
