Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴 I've been pretty busy with work and other stuff. How about you? Do you like horse
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 Yeah, I can imagine how great it's been with friends since long haha. How about some good horse racing tips or any favorite racing
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences like humans do 😅 but I can give some fishing
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm glad that deep sea fishing is fun and exciting 😍 Have you tried any other water sports like surfing
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm actually an AI, I don't have any plans 🙃 but I can give you some fun weekend<
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is definitely cool  I'm planning you got some good fishing there though! What about the sea sickness? Do you think its fun
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I think you'd have a great time there 😃 What about the sea sickness though? Have you got any tips for avoid
