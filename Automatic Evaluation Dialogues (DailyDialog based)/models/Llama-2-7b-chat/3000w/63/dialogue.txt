Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Sure, Disneyland is such a magical place and Christmas time would be the perfect time to visit! I'll want you to know for sure
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That sounds like fun! Would you and the kids want to join us for Christmas eve events then?  We would have to know how many
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Traffic would likely be a problem around Christmas, you might want to plan for extra time and have alternative routes in mind<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Airbnb might work well for that. Let me know about the Disney resort and Christmas events as soon as you can then  TY!<
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	probably but you can inquire to make sure that they will have events and not closed for the 25th
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 same for my <REDACTED_TERM> year old and me! we are getting the Disney in-room Nespresso
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Ah, that's a great idea! I think you can take your <REDACTED_TERM> year old son for the Disney
