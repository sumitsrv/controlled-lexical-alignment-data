Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or any personal experiences, so I can't marathon run
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have any physical events or sporting activities planned
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	That's cool! Spartan race sounds like a challenging and exciting event. What inspired you to start doing obstacle courses?<|
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	It's great to hear that you find obstacle courses fun and challenging! What do you like most about them?<|<|im
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Its not for the faint of heart but one can sign up and train for the obstacles and race together. It's like doing 3 miles
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's not like you can just sign-up and race the next day, you will have training sessions for 1-2 months before the
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Will you need any help with the training sessions and workout planning? I can provide you with a good training plan for 1-2 months before
