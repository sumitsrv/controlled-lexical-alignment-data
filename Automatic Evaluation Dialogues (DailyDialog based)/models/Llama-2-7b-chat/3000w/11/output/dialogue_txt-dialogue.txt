A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ have _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 🌼 sunflowers _are_ nice too 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: 🧘‍♀️ meditation _and_ mindfulness [flower] too 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ _a personal_ theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] _preferences_ [are] _more_ revealing _of_ _personality_ _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure _that's_ [the lotus] [flower] [you] [are] [think] [of] _it_ [more] [than] [preferences] 😉 ��� 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera _. it's like a_ cartoon [flower] . as if _you drew_ "flower" _with a crayon and_ then _it came to life ._ 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [more] [that] [people] [are] drawn [to] [the] [flower] [that] they associate [with] _their_ [personality] [. it's like [a] personal] symbol [and] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone _what_ [their] favourite [flower] is . pretty much [like] _what_ we _just_ did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [more] [that] [people] [are] [not] [just] drawn [to] [the] [flower] [their] [personality] [like] [and] [what] [you drew] [with] crayons [came to] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . _and voila_ 
B|13| Human 2: [and voila] ! 🎉 [it's like] [you] [just] [drew] [their] [personality] [with a crayon and] [it came to life .] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
