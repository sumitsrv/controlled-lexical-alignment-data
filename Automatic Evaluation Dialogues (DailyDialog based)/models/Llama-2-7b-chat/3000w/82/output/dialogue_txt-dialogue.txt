B|5| Human 2: 🚀 [cigar] [chat] ? 🤣 that's cool ! [how about] we [chat] [about] [the] meaning of life instead ? 
A|6| Human 1: this one _is_ _actually_ from peru , which _is_ more my _taste_ . _smoking isn't_ very _healthy_ _, _but_ it's actually_ quite relaxing , which in a way _is_ _good _for_ your_ health . _haha_
