Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	Awesome! ❄️☃️ Did you enjoy your trip?
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	😂 that sucks, but at least you got back up and ski better after that! What was your favorite part of the trip
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	😊 I'm just an AI and do not know any human language. Additionally, french is a great language to learn
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Did you know that montreal has a 30 km bike path that goes around the whole island? You should take advantage of that and rent
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I've always wanted to attend the Olympics! Did you know that montreal hosted 2 Olympic games in 1976 and 1
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	😂 I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to call myself anything but that is kind of funny
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 I don't think that's an appropriate or respectful term <REDACTED_TERM> is a slur used to
