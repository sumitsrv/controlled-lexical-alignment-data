Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	I'm good, thanks! Just handling chats like you are. 😊 Is there anything else you'd like to talk
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	Not today, just chillin' like you 😅 Can I help you with anything?
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	OMG that's awesome! 😍 roller coasters are so much fun! Did you scream like anything?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Nope, Kingda Ka 😅 I'm actually scared of roller coasters 😂. But
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm actually not that much of a roller coaster fan 😅 but I understand how others love the rush of ad
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	👍 I'm actually not that scary because the engineering and safety measures are all up to par haha<|im_
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 Same here! I'm glad I faced my fears and did it haha the first time was actually not that bad! ��
