Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	Wow, that's exciting! What made you decide to try skydiving?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Seville is a great city for skydiving. Have you done it before?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done skydiving before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're feeling trepidatious! 😂 Have you tried any extreme sports before?<|im_
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Haha that's a great point! Have you tried any water sports before like kayaking or paddleboarding?<|im_
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 Haha that's awesome! White water rafting and skiing are definitely extreme sports you can try! Have you tried any indoor
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
