Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	My apologies! 😅 To answer your question, many pastry chefs have a passion for baking and a desire to create
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	😅 I'm just an AI trained to make conversation! But you're not far off - pastry chefs do
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	🤔 I'm actually a cake chef and have the ability to feel the emotions that foods evoke in people ha
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	😋 vanilla icing all the way! And I have to say- you're quite good at this pastry chef thing
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I'm just a chatbot for a food delivery app, but you can have all the vegetables and ha ha- that's not
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	Oh, dance is a funny topic for me 😂 I'm just an AI and have no physical body to move around
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	😂 I can imagine! How's the best cake you've ever made? Tell me all about it! �
