Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	Ah, my apologies! It's possible that you have met me in a previous chat or interaction. I'm just an AI,
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's possible! I'm an AI trained to assist and dance with you. How can I help you today?<|im_
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Did you have a fun time?
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, so no cardiologist here 😊 How can I help you with dance practice or any other
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm here to assist you with any questions or queries you have. You can ask me anything, and I'll do my best to help
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm not sure what you mean by elitist. I am designed to assist and provide helpful responses to the best of my abilities,
