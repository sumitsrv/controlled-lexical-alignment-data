Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm just here to help you with any questions or tasks you may have. Is there something specific you'd like to chat about or ask
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	I understand. Sometimes it can be overwhelming to keep up with emails, especially if you have a lot of them. Would you like me
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	that's great! outside work, I enjoy reading books, watching movies and spending time with my friends and family 🙂
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or enjoy movies 🙂 but I can recommend some
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	oh okay 🙂 well, there are many great action movies out there but Terminator is definitely one of the classics 
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	😂 sure, no worries! it's easy to forget details of movies that you only watch bits and pieces of 
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	not happy ending 😢 but it's a classic that will always be remembered as one of the best action movies of all time
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 you're welcome! it's definitely worth watching, and it has one of the most iconic ending scenes in movie history<|im
Human 1:	 Thanks!
