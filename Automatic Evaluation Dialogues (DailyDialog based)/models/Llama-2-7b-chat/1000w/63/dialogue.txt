Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Sure, that sounds like fun! 😊 I'll check with the kids and get back to you. Could you provide more
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	Great! 😃 I've just confirmed with the kids and they would love to join you for Disneyland trip around Christmas
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	😂 Yeah, you're right. Traffic around the holidays can be brutal. But will be fun to have
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Great idea! 🏡 Airbnb can be a convenient and affordable option for accommodation close to Disneyland. I will look
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point. Disneyland will likely be closed on Christmas Eve and the 25th. So, let's plan for the 2
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 Great! Let me take a look at that for you. What are your top <REDACTED_TERM> this year?<
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Ah, that's great! What about for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old? Does he have any similar interests?
