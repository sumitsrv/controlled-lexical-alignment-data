Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Great, thanks! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal feelings or weekend plans, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or the ability to watch live events. 
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	😅 Haha, I can understand why you would think that. But sharks are actually really interesting creatures. Did you know
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	🐝 UFC? Never heard of it. What is it?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm  pretty competitive and like to try new things haha. It might just be the start of a new hobby. Although
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Yeah I'm pretty sure that will win you the tournament  haha. You should definitely try jiu jitsu out and see how long
