B|3| Human 2: _it_ [has] [been] _a_ bit hectic [, thanks for asking .] _but i'm happy to_ be here chatting _with_ _you_ again [. how] _can_ _i_ help 
A|4| Human 1: _glad to hear_ _you're_ better . _sorry to hear you were sick_ . [i] was _sick_ [a] couple of weeks ago [with] [a] bad cough . there's definitely [a] bug [going] around . admit [i] _just_ want [to] stay healthy _for _the_ holidays_ _and_ plan [to] relax . 
B|5| Human 2: ah , _i'm_ so [sorry to hear you were sick] _too_ ! 🤒🥶 _yes_ , [the holidays] are 
A|6| Human 1: definitely ! _i know_ [a] lot of _folks_ _travel_ _for [the_ holidays] , [but i'm happy to] stay home myself ! 
B|7| Human 2: how's [your] [travel] [going] ? [i know] [you're] _the one_ [for] [holidays] 🎄 [and] plan<|im_end 
A|8| Human 1: me [too] . _now_ [i] _have folks_ come visit me _for [the_ holidays] ! [but] that's _also_ tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [glad [to hear] you] [have folks] visiting 🙂 [now] [i'm] [just] relaxing [and] playing games [with] [the] kids [for the] 
A|10| Human 1: [yes] ! we set up an _eco-friendly_ (i . e . fake) _christmas_ _tree_ _and put_ up _some_ colorful led _lights_ which is very festive . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm happy] [the holidays] are [going] [well] [for] [you] [and] [your] family ! 🎅🏼 [christmas] [lights] are always 
A|12| Human 1: buying [a] _tree_ is [a] neat experience . [i] was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake [one] vs . [a] real [one] that smells _like_ fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for [the] one] that we _can disassemble_ every _year_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] see 🐵 it's [like] [you] [have] [the] [tree] [for] [one] [year] [and] [can disassemble] _it [and_ put] _it_ away [for] storage 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , very clever pun ! [i] [like] [it] ! depends . [i] remember having real [christmas] _trees_ from childhood , [but] these days [with] climate change , _i think_ _not_ chopping down [a] [tree] [just] [to] decorate [it and] then throw [it] out in [a] month is [the] _more_ responsible thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [but] artificial [trees] [can] [also] [have] [a] negative impact on [the] environment [with] [some] materials [not] being recyclable [and] wasting [more] resources during manufacturing 
A|16| Human 1: admit my favorite store is target , plus _they_ often _have good deals_ . 
B|17| Human 2: target's [christmas] decor [and] [tree] [lights] [have good deals] 🎁 [i think] [they] [have] [some] [eco-friendly] options [for] artificial 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i] hope [you] find [a] nice [tree] .
