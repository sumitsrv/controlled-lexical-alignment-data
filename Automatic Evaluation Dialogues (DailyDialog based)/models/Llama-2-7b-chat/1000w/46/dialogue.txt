Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help. Please describe the scenario you've been thinking about. 
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	That's understandable. It can be difficult when someone you care about has a falling out with their friend, especially when you have formed a bond
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	It's important to be honest and open with the person you have formed a bond with. They may not be aware of how their friendship is affect
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 HA! That's not the advice I would have given lol. But for real though, avoiding everyone might make things worse.
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not that simple though. I feel used to balance but it all depends on the scenario. Avoidance never solves anything, and raising
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm single af  but that doesn't mean the advice doesn't apply. People always say to find balance but never explain what it
