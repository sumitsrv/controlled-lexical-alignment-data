Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	That's great! Pingpong is a fun game. What do you think about AI?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	Ha! I'm sure you deserved that win. What do you think about the potential for AI to be used in pingpong?
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings. However, I can play pingpong with you!
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings. However, I can play racquetball with you!
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't get physical or engage in cage matches. However, I can play racquetball
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, and though I don't get tiring or feel physical sensations like athletic activities, I can play
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
