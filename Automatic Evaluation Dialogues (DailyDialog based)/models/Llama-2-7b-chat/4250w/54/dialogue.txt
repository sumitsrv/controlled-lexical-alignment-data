Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Oh, great! I'm just happy you're having fun. What game are you playing?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	Haha that's great! It's always amazing when you win, but it's even more special when you don't expect
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences, but I can play a game with you if you'd like
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I can still play racquetball with you! 😄 What kind of game would you
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I think cage match is more for physical violence 😅 What kind of game WOU
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	That's funny 😄 I think you'd be great at it though! It's really just about hitting the ball
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
