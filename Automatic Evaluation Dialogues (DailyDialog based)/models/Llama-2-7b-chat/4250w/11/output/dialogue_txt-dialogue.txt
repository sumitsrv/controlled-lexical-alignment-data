B|11| Human 2: 💡 [it] [did] [make sense] _, and_ you're making [it] [more] interesting _with the_ [flower] [cartoon] analogy ! [i think] that' 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with the] [person] some [more] [, and] ask them some [more] questions [, and] _gradually_ develop [a] [sense] [of] _what_ they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two _to_ five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: 💡 [and] _that's_ [what] [the gerbera] [flower] [person] [did] [with] [you] ! they [gradually] got [to] know [you] [over] time [and] developed
