A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! they're definitely one _of_ _the_ more challenging _pastries_ [to make] _, but_ [i'm] sure you'll do 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once or twice _so_ far [, but] they haven't been _flakey_ enough . _i'm trying to_ figure out why _. what kind of_ cookies _have you made ?_ 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] [them] _all_ ! 😆 okay [, but] seriously , [croissants] are _a_ [great] challenge [to] [have] . _it_ takes _some_ 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] _think_ [so] ! [what kind of] [flakey] [croissants] [have you made ?] 🥐<|im_end 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is _a good idea_ . _i'll_ give [it] [a] _try_ _next time ._ would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [croissants] are [a good idea] 😋 [i'll] [have] [to] [try] [that] [next time [.] what kind of] [sweet] treats [have you] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people _don't_ ! _but yeah ,_ me _too_ , i [think] i'd _eat_ [pastries] [all] [the] [time] if i _could get_ away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [but] [don't] [you] [think] [that] [the] [flakey] [croissants] [could get] [too] buttery _and_ rich ? [i'm trying to] [eat] healthier 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] i paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [with] [you] on [that] 😂 [but yeah ,] [too] much butter [and] sugar can be <redacted_ter 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution i need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
