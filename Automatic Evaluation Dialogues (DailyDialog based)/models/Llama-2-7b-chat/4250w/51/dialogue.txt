Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴 How about you watch some racing with me? I've got a great horse that I think will
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😂 Yeah, watching horse racing with friends is great! It's been about a month since I last had some time to myself
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm actually thinking about going fishing with some friends this weekend. How great that you had some time to yourself! It's
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 Have fun fishing with your friends! I'm actually going to a music festival this weekend. It's been a long time since
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Just once! I got super sea sick  haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is great! I'd love to visit there some day. Have you been before? What about the weekend though? How are your plans
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've been there 3 times actually. It never get old! Tokyo have such great city life with the blend of traditional and modern culture
