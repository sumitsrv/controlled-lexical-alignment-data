B|5| Human 2: 😅 [cigar] ? [how] interesting ! [how about] we [chat] [about] something _more_ interesting ? 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ _is actually_ from peru , which _is_ [more] my taste . smoking isn't very healthy , _but_ it's _actually_ quite _relaxing_ , which in a _way_ _is_ good _for_ _your health_ . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: 🤖 how's [your] day going ? did _you_ try [the] [cigar] [for] [relaxing] purposes ? [haha] [just] curious �� 
A|8| Human 1: [haha] "you only _live_ once" as they _say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: you're [actually] [the] [one] who [just] [live] once [haha] [. how about] [your health] ? are _you_ [enjoying] _it_ ? <|im_end 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , _that_ _is_ _not_ [what] i was _getting_ at , _but_ yes _that would_ be nice . do [you] believe in _reincarnation_ ?
