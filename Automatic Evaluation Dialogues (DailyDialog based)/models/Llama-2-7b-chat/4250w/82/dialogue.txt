Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	😊 chat away! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	😅 cigar? How interesting! How about we chat about something more interesting?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	🤖 How's your day going? Did you try the cigar for relaxing purposes? haha Just curious ��
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 You're actually the one who just live once haha. How about your health? Are you enjoying it?<|im_end
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	🤔 I'm just an AI not reincarnation haha but what you say about cigar relaxing is actually
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	haha  you're just getting more and more meta after death brain-computer interface whats that about? 🤯<
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 not just harder but much more complicated task that would need way more brain-computer interface
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
