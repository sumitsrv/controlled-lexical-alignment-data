Human 2:	Oh, wow! That sounds great!  Skiing is such a fun and exhilarating experience.
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 Haha, that's great! It can be challenging to learn how to turn on the ice, but once you get the hang of
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help you practice your French.  May I know what level you're at and what topics you'
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and don't have personal experiences, but I'd be happy to help you plan your trip to Montreal
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to watch Youtube or attend Olympic events
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to pull myself along the sides or attend any events in person<|im_
