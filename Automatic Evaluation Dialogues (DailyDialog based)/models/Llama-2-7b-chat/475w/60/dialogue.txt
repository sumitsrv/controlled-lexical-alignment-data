Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a great way to challenge yourself and experience the outdoors. How was your trip?<|
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Yes, I can definitely help you with that. What movie would you like to watch?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah nice! Yeah, they can be a bit tricky. What movie do you recommend?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	😂 that's funny. What do you guys do for fun around here?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	🏞️ I see! Yes, the southern lights are very beautiful! Where was that you saw them?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	You've been to Australia 😍 that's so awesome! I'd love to visit the Great Barrier Reef som
