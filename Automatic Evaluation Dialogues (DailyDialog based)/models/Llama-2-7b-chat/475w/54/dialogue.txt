Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! 🎉 Pingpong is a fun game. What do you think about AI?<
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	I'm glad you won! 😊 It's great that you're taking credit for it. What do you think about
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings. However, I can play games that you enjoy, like
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Haha, you're really trying to keep the game going! 😂 I think racquetball is a great sport for those
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have physical abilities, so I can't engage in cage match or any
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	tennis and racquetball have some similarities, though you use a different ball and don't
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
