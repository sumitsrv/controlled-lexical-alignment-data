Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! I didn't know you were into horse racing. Do you have a favorite horse or race?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	Ah, I see! 😂 It's great that you're able to catch up with friends. How often do you get
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences like humans do. However, I can provide information and advice on deep sea
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	How about I give you some fun weekend plans? 😄
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	It's nice once in a while, but I prefer to stay indoors most of the time. 😅<|im
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is definitely a great city! I've heard the food there is amazing. Have you tried any of the local cuisine while you
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I'm not sure though, New York is such a bust city that I think I would get overwhelmed trying to see everything there
