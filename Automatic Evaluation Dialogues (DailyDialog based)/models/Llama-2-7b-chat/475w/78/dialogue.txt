Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	My apologies! Let me rephrase: What inspired you to pursue a career in pastry arts?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm just good at my job! 😊 So, how long have you been a cake chef? What inspired you to
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I'm just glad you're not psychic- that would have been too creepy! haha<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	Oh wow- that's a tough choice! I have  too many favorite foods.. But if I had to pick just one,
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?

Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm a  dance instructor actually- and you are the first person to guess that correctly! How funny is that?<|im
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 *sigh* I wish I could say the same- but alas, cakes are not my specialty. What kind of dance do
