A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: oh , [croissants] are _a_ [great] choice ! they're _a_ classic french pastry _that_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to make] _, but_ _with_ practice 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once _or_ twice so far [, but] _they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why . what kind _of cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] _a_ lot [of] different types [of cookies] over _the_ years [, but] _i_ [have] [to] _say_ _that_ my favorite are chocolate chip [cookies] . 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai ai ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal experiences like humans do [, but] [i've] [been] trained on 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] good idea . i'll _give_ it [a] try next time . would _you_ [say] _you_ [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal preferences [or] taste buds [, but] _i_ can [give] [you] _some_ tips on [how] 
A|10| Human 1: _some people_ [don't] ! _but yeah ,_ me _too_ [, _i] think_ i'd eat pastries all [the] time if [i] could _get_ away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [the] same way ! [some people] [say] [that] [cookies] are [too] [sweet] [, but] [i think] they're perfect just [the] way [they] are . _and_ 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ being _marketed as a fat substitute ,_ [and] caused all sorts [of] crazy _stomach upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think] [that] [was] ever [marketed as a fat substitute [,] [but] yeah ,] [some people] do [get] [stomach upsets] from consuming 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
