A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai bot , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can certainly help [you] _with_ your flower- 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] [flower] ! _it's_ [a] lovely choice . [the lotus] _is_ _not_ only [a] beautiful _and_ fragrant [flower] , but 
A|6| Human 1: oh , [it's] [not] research ! [just] _a personal_ _theory_ . _i think_ _that_ [flower] [preferences] are _more_ revealing of _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: _that's_ very interesting ! [i think] [people] often associate [the lotus] [flower] _with_ spirituality _and_ enlightenment . _is_ there [a personal] significance 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's _like_ a_ cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] _crayon_ [and] then _it_ came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [crayon] [theory] ? [i] [like] [it] ! [it's like] [the] [flower] embodies [a] playful [and] carefree spirit _. and_ [the] colors 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ _what_ _their_ favourite _flower is_ . pretty much [like] _what_ we [just] did . _does_ _that_ make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [the] [flower is] [their] [personality] in plant form ! [and] [the] colors ... [what] about [that] ? [does] [someone] prefer [a] [more] muted [and] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk_ [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] ask _them_ some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense of [what] they're [like] , over [the] course of maybe two _to_ five years [. and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [like a] [flower] _that's_ [just] budding [with] [personality] [and] potential ! [and] [the] [more] [you] [talk] [to] [them] , [the] [more] they'll reveal 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
