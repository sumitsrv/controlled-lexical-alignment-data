Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been a busy week! How about yours?</assistant> </s>
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling well 🤧 If you need anything, feel free to reach out to
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have the budget for it 😜 How did your travelling this year go? <|im_end|
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	How's the weather? I have no plans for this week, just chillin at home 😴 did you have big plans
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	I have never been there, but it sounds nice 🌴 Is it humid too good year round?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 lotion for the whole day? 🤷‍♀️ you gotta be careful with your skin out there
