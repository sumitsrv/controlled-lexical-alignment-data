Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or personal experiences, so I can't train for marathons
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal plans or events to participate in
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	That sounds like a fun and challenging race! How did your last Spartan race go?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Ah, I see! So you're into obstacle course racing, and you enjoy the challenges that come with it. It's great
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	February sounds like a great time for a race! 😊 Do you have any plans or events lined up for next month? 
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	2 months is about the right amount of time for training for a Spartan race. It's good you are giving yourself enough time to work
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Awesome! Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice. 🏋️‍♂️💪 Let's
