Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm just hanging out here, making sure all is well in the chat. It's nice to see you!<|im_
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! 😅 emails can be overwhelming at times. Is there anything else I can help
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	I'm glad you asked! 😊 outside work, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading books, and practicing
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	no 😅 I'm more of a fan of romantic comedies and mystery novels
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	yea, Terminator 2 is a classic! 😊 what are your thoughts on it?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	🤔 that's okay! it's a long time ago, but the end scene always touches me<|im_
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	🤝 it's not happy ending like a romantic comedy, but touching. the Terminators have a strong bond<
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	it's great! you will enjoy it 😊 watch it with someone you love
Human 1:	 Thanks!
