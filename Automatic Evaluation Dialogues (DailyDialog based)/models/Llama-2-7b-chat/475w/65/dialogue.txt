Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Good! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Oh no, sorry to hear that! Losing your moped can be so frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?<
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 lol that's not the only reason The mechanic says I might have to get a new moped
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	The good news is your moped is not the only way you can get to work. Did you drive today? Do you have any other options?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Okay good. Yeah the Warriors game last night was pretty great. Did you catch it?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Haha well they're definitely not the only good team but yeah their record speaks for itself
