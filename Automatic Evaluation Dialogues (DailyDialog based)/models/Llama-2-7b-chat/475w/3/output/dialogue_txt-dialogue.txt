A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the rain_ started early this year _... [i_ _don't] like_ them _too much_ . they make _days_ gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: it's understandable [that] _you_ may not [like] rainy [days] , _but_ they're also important for [the] environment and agriculture . [the rain] helps 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: [water] shortages are _a_ common problem _in_ many parts [of] [the] world . [the rain] helps _to_ recharge [the] _water supply_ and keep [the] ecosystem health 
A|8| Human 1: _haha ... [i_ don't] _think_ _i can_ survive [in] [that] [weather] ever . [just] [the] rains at 50 degrees make me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms

B|11| Human 2: yes , that's true . [the rain] [can] [have] many benefits , such as replenishing [water] sources and supporting agriculture . [but] [too much] 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn interesting . did [you] _see_ [it] ?
