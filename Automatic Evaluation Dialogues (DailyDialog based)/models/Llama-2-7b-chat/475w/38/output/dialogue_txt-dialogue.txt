A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ _do_ _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like_ _chat_ _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're cool _! some_ people [like] [you] _can_ use them _to_ [chat] _and_ get information or help _with_ tasks . [what] [about] [you] ? [do] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have_ made [some] _great_ _progress_ over last few years . [do] [you] _think the positives_ _outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: well , _i [think_ the positives] definitely [outweigh the negatives] . it's [great] _that_ [you] _can_ use chatbots [to] get information or 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: ( 😄 ) yeah impersination _is_ _a_ concern , but there _are_ ways [to] detect _and_ prevent [it] _. the_ field _of_ chatbot 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] [! some] [of] these _bots are_ very engaging [and] funny . _they are_ now _good at_ _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far [are] we from [the] time these _bots_ start _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: ( 🤔 ) that's [the] dream [! some] [bots are] _already_ [good at] [giving monologues] , [and] [even] impersonating 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] take _many_ different forms as [a] product [. the] research implication [is] also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how _ai_ research _has_ progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping _on _the_ moon_ 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: 🤓 [the moon] [has] nothing [on the] [progress] chatbots [and] [ai] [are] making ! [they] [will] revolutionize [many] industries [and] make 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ [already] [do] pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] [the moon] ! 🙂 [the] [auto-suggestions] [have] come [a] long way [and] [will] continue [to] improve . they're 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 _nice_ having this _conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: 😊 [nice] [conversation with you] too !
