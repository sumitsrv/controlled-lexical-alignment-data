Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🤖, I don't have a day going, but I'm here to help you
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🤖, I don't have a part-time job or class like you do<|
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	That sounds great 😊 I'm just an AI that was created to help with some work but I don't take classes
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	😂 that's adorable! What tea ware do you make?
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	🎨 would you like to make some tea ware pottery together? I'm sure that would be the most fun way to
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Ahh, you are the pottery master 😅 I would love that! Maybe one day we'll make tea ware together
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 that's cool! I like the one youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> too! The host talks
