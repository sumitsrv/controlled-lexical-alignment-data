Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	It's great that you have a race coming up! What do you think your time will be like?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	It's fun and challenging but not overly difficult like marathons which are more time-consuming. 
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I'm not sure, but I'll definitely consider it! It sounds like a fun and challenging race.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	It's not about the time you take but the fun and obstacles which  can be challenging for your training sessions. Its good 2
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Will do! It's good to have a training ground to practice the obstacles and technique for the race.
