Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	😍 I heard that too! Would you like me to show you the way to microkitchen?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Ah, cold weather 🥶 indeed! Microkitchen is giving out jackets that are perfect for the chill.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	100%! Its important for our health and well-being to stay warm and cozy during cold weather.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Sure did 😊 Where are you from?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	😂 Where did you live before the cold weather?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 Nice place they have here! did you get the last time you were here?
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 Anyways, should we get the goodies and you can walk there?
