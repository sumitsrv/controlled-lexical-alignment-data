B|3| Human 2: oh , [great] ! [i'm] glad you're [trying] something new . [it's] always fun [to learn how to make] something delicious . 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once _or_ twice _so far _,_ but_ they haven't _been_ flakey enough . [i'm] _trying to_ figure _out_ why . _what_ kind _of cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _and_ [have] [made] _a_ wide variety [of cookies] [, but] [croissants] are definitely on my to-make list ! _it_ 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought _, thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] actually [trying] [out] _a_ buttery shortbread recipe _next_ . [it's] [been] [great] [so far [,] thanks] for _the_ recommendation ! [what] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] _good_ idea . i'll give [it] [a] _try_ _next time_ . would _you_ say _you_ [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ?

B|11| Human 2: [i think] you'll [have] [to] [try] [the] [croissants] [too] [next time] , they're [a] classic [pastries] [that] [people] love [all] over [the] world 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was _when_ <redacted_term> was _being_ marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [the] marketing [and] advertising industry [could] [learn] [a] thing [or] two from [you] [when] [it] comes [to] [being] creative [with] <redacted 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] [enjoy] sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
