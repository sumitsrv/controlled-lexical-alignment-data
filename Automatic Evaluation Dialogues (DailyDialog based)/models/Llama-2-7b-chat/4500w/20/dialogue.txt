Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a great choice! Stirfry is delicious. What about you would you say is the most important thing in life?<
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	Ah, ice cream!  That's a tough one too. I would say love and kindness
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Mint chocolate chip is a great one too! How about you? What's the most creative thing you've ever done?
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	That's a tough one... How about you believe the afterlife will be like from your favorite movie or TV show and why?<|
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	That's understandable. What would you say the chances are that there is something more after we pass from this world?<|im_
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 That's supernatural experience you have ever had and the world would like to believe it. What are more topics than afterlife?<|
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
