Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 That's great! It's important to enjoy the little things in life. Just went to a meeting with some colleagues. You know
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Haha, you're right! 😅 actually went indoors all day to work on some projects. You know how it
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	😂 hahahaha that's funny thought though. You work pretty all day indoors? What did you do
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	😂 fish researcher hahaha you're the first person that thought that! But no, I work in HR.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	Haha interestingly dangerous 😂 that's very funny hahahah. What kind of work you do in HR
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Ah that's interesting! Yeah the things you work on have some psychological element to them. It's not all about climbing mountains but
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	I'm not the most climbing expert, but yes indoor gyms have their own psychological and physical challenges that you need to
