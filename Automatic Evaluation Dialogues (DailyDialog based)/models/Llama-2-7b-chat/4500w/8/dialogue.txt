Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	It has been a busy week, but I'm here to help you with any questions or tasks you may have. How about you?<|
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell 🤒 I wish you a speedy recovery! If you need
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have budget for your sick leave 😅 I think most AI would have stopped with the travelling part this
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm too sick for plans 😅 I think the most exciting thing this week has been binge-watching<|
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 good for the skin 😊 It's a place I would like to visit too
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I'm going there for the beaches toooo! It's like you have never been to Hawaii with all this lotion carry
