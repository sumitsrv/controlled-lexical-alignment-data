Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Oh, wow! Yes, I've heard great things about it. It's a South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by B
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	I actually didn't do much last weekend. Just stayed at home and binge-watched some TV shows. How about you?<
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	😍 Yeah, I'm loving it too! I can't get enough of Baby Yoda and the Mandalor
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	Oh, definitely! I'm so excited for the new Spider-Man movie 🤩 What do you think about it?<<|
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Well, the new Spider-Man movie has some pretty intense action scenes and villains, so it's understandable
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	😂 I think he's absolutely adorable! Tom Holland is a great actor and he brings so much energy and personality
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	🤣 Loki is actually a great villain! He's really complex and interesting, and Tom Holland does an amazing job
