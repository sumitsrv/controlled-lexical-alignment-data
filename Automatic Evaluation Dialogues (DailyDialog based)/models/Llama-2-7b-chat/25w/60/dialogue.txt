Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! I'm just an AI chatbot, so my day is pretty consistent. Here to help you with any questions

Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Well, if you ever visit Australia, definitely try to see the southern lights. They're very<|im_end
