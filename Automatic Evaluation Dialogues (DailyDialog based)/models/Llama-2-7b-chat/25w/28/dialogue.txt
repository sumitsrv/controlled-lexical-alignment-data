Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Breakfast is definitely the most important meal of the day. Did you have anything interesting or exciting happen recently
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Eggs and hash browns are a classic breakfast combo! They're both good sources of protein and carbohydrates.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	That's a tough one! I think I would have to choose pizza. I could eat it every day and never get tired of it
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	Haha, yeah, Soylent is definitely not the answer! Well, if you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I love your answer! It shows that you have a good sense of humor about food. Speaking of food, do you have any fun food-
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	Ah, you want to talk food! *excitedly* There are so many delicious foods out there, but if I had to
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
