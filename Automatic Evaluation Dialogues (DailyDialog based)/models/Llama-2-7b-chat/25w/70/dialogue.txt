Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	creation progress is going well, thanks for asking!
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	I use Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing and Audacity for audio editing. What about you?
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	I like to experiment with different genres and styles, so I don't have a specific one that I stick to. But I do enjoy creating
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	😄 Thank you! It's always great to connect with other creatives, especially those who share the same passions. 
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	That's cool! What kind of music do you play? Do you have any recordings or performances that you could share with me?<|
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	Oh, I see 😅 Yeah, playing guitar can take a lot of time and effort, but it's definitely worth it in
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	exactly! It's like learning a new language. Once you have the basics down, you can build on them and create something truly amazing
