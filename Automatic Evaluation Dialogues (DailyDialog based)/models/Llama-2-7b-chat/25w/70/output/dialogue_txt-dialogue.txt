B|5| Human 2: _i_ [use] adobe premiere pro [for] [video] editing and audacity [for] audio editing [. what] about [you] ? 
A|6| Human 1: _oh_ _cool ! what_ sort _of music do you_ compose ? 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ _like_ [to] experiment with different genres and styles , so _i_ don't have _a_ specific one that _i_ stick [to] . but _i_ [do] enjoy creating
