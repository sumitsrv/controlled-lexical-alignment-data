Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good
Human 2:	Oh, nice! Hint water is definitely one of my go-tos as well. Have you tried any other flavors?<|im
Human 1:	 watermelon
Human 2:	Ah, yes! Watermelon is definitely one of the best flavors. I love how fruity and refreshing it is.
Human 1:	 I see. Yeah some are pretty strange
Human 2:	Yeah, sometimes they can be a bit too unique for my taste. But hey, variety is the spice of life, right?<|
Human 1:	 lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird
Human 2:	Oh no, that does sound strange! But hey, at least it's an adventure trying new flavors, right?<|<
Human 1:	 that sounds pretty tasty actually
Human 2:	yeah, maybe I'll give it a try next time
Human 1:	 do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place
Human 2:	hmm that sounds like a plan, but only if we can get it in a bowl with sprinkles on top<|im_end
Human 1:	 lol
Human 2:	oh man, that's quite a few exclamation points you're using there 😂
