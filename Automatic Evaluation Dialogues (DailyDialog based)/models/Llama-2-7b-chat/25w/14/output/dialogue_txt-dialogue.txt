B|7| Human 2: _it was_ pretty fun _! i'm_ _glad i did it_ , even though _it was_ pretty _scary_ _at_ times 😅<|im 
A|8| Human 1: [it was] [scary] ! [it was] actually kingda ka , _the_ world's tallest roller coaster . ever _heard of it_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: yeah , [i] have [heard of it] ! _it's_ definitely _not_ for [the] faint [of] heart _, but_ [it] sounds like [you] had a blast � 
A|10| Human 1: oh wow [! _i'm] not_ on _that_ level yet [, but] [i] understand [the] appeal . are [you] an adrenaline junkie [at] _all_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: _haha_ , no [i'm not] [! i] [just] like trying new things [and] experiencing [the] thrill [of it] [all] 😅< 
A|12| Human 1: same [! i] guess [the] roller coaster wasn't [so] bad because [i] _trust_ [the] engineering [haha] 
B|13| Human 2: exactly ! _it's_ important [to] have [trust] in [the] safety measures put in place 💯 
A|14| Human 1: maybe [not] [so] much [at] [the] time [, but] [i] am [glad i did it] now _that_ [it's] done , know what [i] mean ? 
B|15| Human 2: absolutely ! sometimes [it's] [the] scariest moments [that] turn out [to] be [the] most rewarding 😅<|im
