Human 2:	We can work together to solve your problem or answer your question. Just let me know what you need help with and we'll take it from there
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	I'm just a language model, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, but I can provide you with information on different meeting sync
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	Sounds good! Let's take a look at some options for lunch sync
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
