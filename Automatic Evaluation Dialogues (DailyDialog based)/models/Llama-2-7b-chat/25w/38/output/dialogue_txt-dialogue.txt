B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do you _think_ about human like chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're fascinating ! _they_ _have_ _the_ potential _to_ revolutionize _the_ way _we_ interact _with_ technology . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , [we] seemed [to] [have] made _some_ great progress over last few years . do you [think] _the positives_ _outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: definitely ! [the positives] _far_ [outweigh the negatives] _. they_ _can_ help us [to] save _time_ , increase productivity , _and_ improve [the] customer experience 
A|6| Human 1: like impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds [far] fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: (laughs) yes , absolutely ! [the] ability for chatbots [to] impersonate humans _is_ _a_ fascinating area _of_ _research_ . while 
A|8| Human 1: true that _! some_ [of] these bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny [. they] _are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ [far] _are_ [we] from [the] [time] these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: (laughs) that's definitely _a_ possibility [! some] researchers [are] _already_ exploring [the] use [of] chatbots in virtual reality environments , 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] [research] implication [is] also huge ! _it will_ signify _how ai research_ has progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] like stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might _be_ overselling _it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: (smiling) yes , [it] definitely [is] ! [the] possibilities [are] endless , [and] [it will] [be] exciting [to] see [how ai research] unfolds 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions [already] do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: 2023 predictions: [the] future [of] chatbots 🤖🧑‍💻 (1
