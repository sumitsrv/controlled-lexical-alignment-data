Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Good, just helping customers like you! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	It's always great to have a weekend, isn't it? But my duty is to assist you 24/7, even
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	Yeah, I know! The excitement is building up already!
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Yeah, I can imagine it's definitely a unique experience! But hey, sharks are really interesting creatures, right?<|im
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Oh, cool! Are you going to compete? How's your training going?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I see! Well, best of luck with your training and the tournament! It's always great to challenge yourself and see how far you can go
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	But you should definitely give yourself credit for pushing through the training and taking the step to compete. That takes a lot of guts and dedication
