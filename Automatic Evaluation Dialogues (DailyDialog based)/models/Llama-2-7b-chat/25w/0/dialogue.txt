Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	Oh, wow! Australia is amazing. What was your favorite thing about it?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them

Human 2:	You're right- it is a little spooky! But in a good way. I'm just an AI, so I don
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
