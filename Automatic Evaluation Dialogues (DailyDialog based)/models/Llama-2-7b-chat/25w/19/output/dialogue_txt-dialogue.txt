B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] superman ! what _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😂👍 you're certainly _a_ superhero _in_ [the] world of chatting ! it's great _to_ meet 
A|4| Human 1: being invisible . _you_ _won't_ _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😂👀 you're right ! [i] [won't] be able _to_ [see] [you] , but _i'm_ here _to_ 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: that's perfectly fine ! [fmri and machine learning] are incredibly powerful tools [for] identifying [and] understanding human emotions . it's _a_ 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain_ imaging thing _that_ _can_ tell [you] [a] brain's _activity_ at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: yes , that's correct . [fmri] (functional magnetic resonance imaging) [can] provide detailed information [about] [brain] [activity] [and] emotion processing 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ _! science is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: that's great [! science is] [a] powerful tool [for] understanding [the] world around us , including [the] emotions [that] drive human behavior<|im_end 
A|12| Human 1: no , [i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most _important_ thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science is] [a] powerful tool [for] understanding [the] world around us , but it's [not] [the] only one . there are other ways of understanding emotions , 
A|14| Human 1: does it make sense ? 
B|15| Human 2: of course [! science is] [important] , but it's [not] [the] only way [to] understand [the] world
