Human 1:	 Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.
Human 2:	I understand. It can be nice to have some alone time and enjoy a movie without any distractions. Just make sure to take care of yourself
Human 1:	 Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone. What's your favorite movie?
Human 2:	Haha, that's a good point! I don't have a favorite movie, but I enjoy watching a wide range of genres.
Human 1:	 Get out of town! It's Avatar too. What are the odds!?
