Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going good, just helping customers like you! How can I assist you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Rock climbing can be a great workout and a fun way to challenge yourself. How was the experience? Did
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	movie the darkness Yes, It was good! What about you? Do you like horror movies?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah nice! twists and turns can be great in a movie, they keep the audience engaged. How about your weekend?<|
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hahah yes, it can be fun but also scary when the darkness is overwhelming. What's your favorite dark movie?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	originally from the dark winters can be nice but they are not fun when you're depressed and it never stops snowing LOL I see
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I've been once but that was 2 winters ago and it was too cold here for the southern lights. But Australia is definitely nice!
