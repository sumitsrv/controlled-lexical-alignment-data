Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Sorry, but I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to join you for Disneyland trip around Christmas. <|
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to join you for Christmas events at Disneyland. However, I can certainly help you
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 Great idea! Traffic might be harsh around Christmas time, so you may want to plan ahead and leave early to avoid any delays.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Great idea. Airbnb can be a great option for finding a place to stay close to Disneyland. Let me know if you have any other
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point. Christmas Eve will likely be closed for the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. Let's keep that in mind when planning our trip
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 this time around! <REDACTED_TERM> year old can be a little picky about what they want for Christmas, so
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	That can be a great gift for kids that are around <REDACTED_TERM> year old. What about you? Do you
