Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can try to help you figure out where you
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's possible! Did you have a great time together?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	🤔 Did you have too much to drink? Lol
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm just LLaMA a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, I don't have personal experiences or a private practice card
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm not sure what that is. Did you have a good time at the party?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm not sure what that means. </s>sorry! Lol 😂. It is elitist but real job
