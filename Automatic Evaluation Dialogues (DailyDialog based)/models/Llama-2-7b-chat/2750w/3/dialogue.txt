Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have real-time access to weather information, but I can tell you the current weather

Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 that's too bad. water trouble can be a really big problem.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 the weather can certainly make it more difficult to survive in certain areas, that's for sure.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	that's interesting. 24 hours water supply can make a big difference in people's lives.

Human 2:	Haha, no I was too busy surviving the 50 degrees weather lol
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
