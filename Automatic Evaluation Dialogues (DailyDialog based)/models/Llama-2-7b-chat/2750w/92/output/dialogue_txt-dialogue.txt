A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _good_ _! just_ went _to_ _the_ park _to enjoy the_ sun . _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ great ! [it's] important [to enjoy the] little _things_ in life . 😊 [just] chillin' here , helping 
A|4| Human 1: _haha ,_ _beach_ season _is_ _coming_ ! _you_ _need to look_ _tan_ ! what did _you_ do indoors _all_ [day] ? 
B|5| Human 2: 😂 you're right _! i_ [need to look] [good] for [all] _the beach_ selfies [coming] my way ! [haha ,] indo 
A|6| Human 1: hahahaha _, that's_ _pretty_ funny . ever thought _of_ bringing [your] _work_ [things] [to] [the beach] ?? 
B|7| Human 2: 🤔 _hmm_ [, that's] _actually_ a [good] idea _! i_ could [work] _on_ my [tan] while still being productive ! �� 
A|8| Human 1: [hmm] _i see_ . it sounds _like_ _you_ [work] near [the] water already , no ? _are_ _you_ _some_ kind _of_ _fish_ researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: 🐟 [haha ,] nope [! just] [your] average [beach] hawker selling [fish] 🐟🌞 
A|10| Human 1: woah _! this_ _is very interesting_ [! i] _have_ _honestly_ never heard _of_ such kind _of_ [work] . _is_ it _dangerous_ at [all] ? 
B|11| Human 2: 😅 well [honestly] [the] work's _not_ [dangerous] _, but_ [you] [have] [to] deal with [some] [pretty] [interesting] [things] [like] sunburn _and_ mos 
A|12| Human 1: _hmmm , yes_ [i] [have] heard _that_ . apparently most mountain climbers fall [not] [on] [the] most [dangerous] routes [, but] [on] [the] easier routes , when their guard _is_ down ! sounds [like] [the] same _psychological phenomenon_ . 
B|13| Human 2: ahh [i see] [! this] [psychological phenomenon] you're talking about [is very interesting] . [hmmm , yes] [that] makes sense ��� 
A|14| Human 1: _i'm_ [pretty] amateur [! i] [like] [to] climb at _indoor climbing gyms_ [and] [have] never gone outside [on] [dangerous] routes [actually] . ever tried it yourself ?
