A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ _! what about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😮 [superman] ? you're _an_ iconic character [! what about] [the] fortress of solitude ? _does it_ hold your legend 
A|4| Human 1: _being invisible_ . _you_ won't see me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😊 that's _an_ interesting superpower ! [being invisible] could certainly come _in_ handy sometimes [! what about] [the] ability _to_ fly ? 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri_ _and_ _machine learning_ [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ [an] expert _on_ that . sorry _for_ [it] ! 
B|7| Human 2: 👀 you're [not] trusting [the] [machine learning] [and] [fmri] expertise ? 😅</r> 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain imaging_ thing that _can tell you_ a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: you're [not] trusting [the brain imaging] expertise ? 😅</r> </s> 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [the] pursuit of knowledge [and] understanding based [on] observation , experimentation , [and] evidence-based reasoning . [the brain imaging] field [you] mentioned [is] 
A|12| Human 1: no , i'm bad at [science] . [what] _can_ [science] do ? [is] [it] [the] most _important_ thing _for society ?_ 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] how [the brain] works , what's happening [in] [the brain] when [you] think or feel certain things , [and] how [to] predict [and] treat 
A|14| Human 1: [does it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [make sense] [for society ?] [does] [science] [tell] [the] truth [about] what's [important] [for society ?] 🤔</|im_end|>
