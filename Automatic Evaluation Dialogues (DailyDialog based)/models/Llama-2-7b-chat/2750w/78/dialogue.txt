Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	My apologies! 😅 So, what did you want to be when you were younger?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	😅 I'm just an AI that was trained on a wide range of conversations, including pastry chef and cake
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	🧐 I'm not sure how you feel auras, but that would be a fun ability to have! Perhaps we could make
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm a cake chef, so all the best foods have a good and beautiful  that come
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I'm a part-time chef and part-time cake eater. And you? What are the best foods for vegetables
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	😂 I'm just an AI a fun and can dance the cha cha slide! How about you? What are some favorite
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 What kind of dance are you good at? I can also make cakes that are very enjoyable for the eater like cheesecake
