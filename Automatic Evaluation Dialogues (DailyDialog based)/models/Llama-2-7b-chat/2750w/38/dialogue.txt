Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	Oh, you know, I think they're pretty cool! 🤖 They have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	Well... like you said, the positives are pretty great 🤩! But negatives do exist, and they have to<|
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	😱 Yep, impersination is a real concern. Like you said, far fetched, but a possibility nonetheless
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	🤔 True that! And the monologues you mentioned are a funny and far fetched idea <|im_end|
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	😆 They will also have more futuristic and funny implications like that stepping on the moon thing you mentioned. Like
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The auto-suggestions and the monologues are already good implications, can you imagine more 🤔 like that stepping
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	💆‍♀️ Nice having you here too! The stepping on the moon scenario is pretty funny and far-fetched
