Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants are great. I'm sure they're delicious. But do you know how much work goes into making them?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🤖, but I haven't made cookies or croissants myself. However, I can
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I have made cookies once before but they've been kinda good butt kinda bad. What you thought of them?<|im
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'll give you that.  But next time try to make them flakey instead of soft. It's how they have to be done
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	that's good to know  I think the next time you try them, they have too with pastries, but croissants don't
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	The next time you get to try the cookies I'll give you all that and then <REDACTED_TERM> away  But
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
