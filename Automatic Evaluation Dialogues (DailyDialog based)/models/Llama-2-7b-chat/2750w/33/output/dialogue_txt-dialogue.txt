A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks _. i'm_ trying _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are [great] [. i'm] sure they're delicious . _but_ do _you_ know [how] much work goes into making _them_ ? 
A|4| Human 1: i've _done_ [them] _once_ _or_ twice so far _, but_ _they_ _haven't_ _been_ _flakey_ enough [. i'm] trying _to_ figure out why _. what_ kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai 🤖 [, but] _i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] [or] [croissants] myself . however _, i_ can 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [cookies] [once] before [but] they've [been] kinda [good] butt kinda bad [. what] [you] [thought] [of] [them] ? <|im 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is a [good] idea . _i'll give_ it a _try_ _next time_ . would [you] say [you] [have] a sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'll give] [you] [that] . [but] [next time] [try] [to make] [them] [flakey] instead [of] soft . [it's] [how] [they] [have] [to] be [done] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ [, _i] think_ i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ _the_ [time] if [i] could _get_ _away_ _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: _that's_ [good] [to] know [i think] [the] [next time] [you] [try] [them] , [they] [have] [too] [with] [pastries] [, but] [croissants] [don't] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as a fat substitute , _and_ caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [next time] [you] [get] [to] [try] [the] [cookies] [i'll give] [you] [all] [that] [and] then [<redacted_term>] [away] [but] 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
