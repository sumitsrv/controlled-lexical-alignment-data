Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Great, thanks for asking! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm sorry you're feeling unwell 🤒 Do you think taking a break will help you recover?<|im_
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm sorry you have to take a break 😔 But travelling for a year would be exciting too. How did you
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I have big plans too 😅 December for most part will be chill with the family cause I'm out sick this year.
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I did like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put lotion on
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	😂 I'm going for the whole day cause it got be humid out there and lotion never lasts long �
