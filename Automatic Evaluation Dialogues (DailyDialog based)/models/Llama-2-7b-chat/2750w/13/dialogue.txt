Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	🤖 Are you a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? What did you think of Endgame and Infinity War?
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I see  lol What other movies and shows have you seen? Are there any you'd recommend?
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
