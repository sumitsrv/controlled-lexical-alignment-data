Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?

Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😂 It's great that you're able to spend time with friends! How long had it been since you last saw them

Human 2:	It's been a few years since I've been on a road trip. I would love to go on one again soon! ��
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	I'd love to visit Tokyo! ✈️ Have you been there before? What was your favorite part?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
