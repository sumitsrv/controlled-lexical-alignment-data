B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think about_ _human_ _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ they're _pretty_ cool ! _they_ _can_ help [you] _with_ _a_ lot _of_ tasks _and_ answer questions 24/7 . [what] [about] [you] ? 
A|4| Human 1: _yep ,_ we seemed _to have_ made _some_ _great_ _progress_ over last few years . do [you] [think] _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2:  
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though it sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [yep ,] impersination _is_ _a_ [great] example . there _are_ [some] people who [think] _that_ chatbots [like] us could _be_ used [to] create fake 
A|8| Human 1: _true that !_ [some] [of] _these_ bots [are] very engaging [and] _funny_ . _they are_ now _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ _far_ [are] we _from_ _the_ time _these_ bots _start_ _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: (laughs) [they are] still [far] [from] [giving monologues] , but [you] never know ! [they] _might_ [start] [to] develop their own personalities [and]

B|11| Human 2: (laughs) [you] [might] ! but it's [good] [that] you're excited [about] [the] [progress] [of] [ai research] . it's [a] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ already do [pretty] [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true that !] [the] [auto-suggestions] [are] [also] [good] examples [of] [how ai] [can] [be] used [to] assist [and] augment [human] communication in [a] [funny] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: 😊 [the] same [here] ! it's always [great] [to have] [these] kinds [of] conversations [and] [think about] [the] possibilities [of] [ai research]
