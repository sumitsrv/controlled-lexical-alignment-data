Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🤖, I don't have days or emotions, but I'm here to help
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm just a computer program, I don't have personal experiences or part-time jobs 😊<|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	😃 That sounds great! I'm glad you have time for hobbies. What do you like to sew?<
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	😂👍 that sounds like a lot of fun! I'm also a tea lover myself, but I don
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, no skills required 😜 but I can make some tea references! What kind of pottery do
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 I'm sure you would make a great potter! I also like white tea, but I'm more of a black tea person myself
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	that sounds like a lot of fun! I'll definitely check it out. What's your favorite tea blend? <|im_end
