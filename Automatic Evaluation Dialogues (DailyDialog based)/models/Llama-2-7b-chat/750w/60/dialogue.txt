Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! It can be really good for your mental health to do adventure sports. How was the rock climbing? Did you find
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	It was great! I'm glad you're enjoying yourself! What about your day today?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah that's great! Lots of twists and turns, right?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hahah yes, all the same movie 😅 What's your favorite outdoor activity?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	Hahah that's the same here too! I like winter more than summer but prefer it to be shorter 😅 Yes!
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I see! Ah, well... Australia's definitely nice here too 🙂 You should visit! But yes, the southern lights are
