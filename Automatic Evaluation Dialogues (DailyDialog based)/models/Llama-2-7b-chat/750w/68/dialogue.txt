Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help you understand some concepts. Can you tell me which concepts you are having trouble with and what you have
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	Sure, I'm here to help you. Let's discuss the concepts you're having trouble with right now. Can you please provide
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	Great! I'm glad you're preparing for the test. Can you tell me what concepts you have covered so far?<|im
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	But you'll have to stay focused and not slack off during the weekend. You don't want to fall behind your peers,
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	I'm here with you 100%! This course will not be that tough though. Just like the syllabus indicates
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
