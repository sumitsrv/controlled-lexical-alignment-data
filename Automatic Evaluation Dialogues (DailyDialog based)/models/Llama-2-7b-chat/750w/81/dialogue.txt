Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	That sounds like a lot of fun! 😍 Did you hit the slopes at any resorts?<|im_end
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	😂 That's great that you learned from your experience and got better after it! What's your favorite thing about skiing
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	🤔 I'm just an AI and don't have personal experiences, but I can help you with french phrases
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Did you take any cool pictures or videos while you were skiing? 📸
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and don't have the ability to attend the Olympics 😔
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I've never been skating either 😅 but I think I can pull myself along the sides just fine<|im_end
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I can't pull myself along the sides 🙃 <REDACTED_TERM> just don't <REDA
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
