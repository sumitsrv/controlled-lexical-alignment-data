B|5| Human 2: [i] _see_ . well , [rain] [is] _a_ natural occurrence that's necessary for [the] earth's _weather_ patterns . [it] helps _to_ regulate [the] temperature and 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ _water_ trouble _too ..._ 
B|7| Human 2: [i] understand . [it] _can_ be challenging _to_ adjust _to_ new [water] patterns and [make] [the] best [of] [them] . maybe _there_ are some ways _you_ could learn more 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ ... [i] _don't_ think [i can] survive in that [weather] ever . [just] [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit in heated rroms

B|11| Human 2: [haha] that's _interesting_ ! yeah , [rain] [can] [have] its downsides [too ...] [like] making [the] roads slippery and making [it] harder 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did [you] [see] [it] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [haha] , that's [interesting] ! [climate change] [can] [have] [a] big impact on [weather] patterns around [the] world , including droughts and storms
