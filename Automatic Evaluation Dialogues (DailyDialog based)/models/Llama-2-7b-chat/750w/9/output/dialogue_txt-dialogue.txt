B|3| Human 2: _oh ,_ _you_ _know_ , _just_ _the_ usual . helping users _like_ _you_ _with_ their queries [. how] _can_ _i_ help _you_ today ? <|im_end 
A|4| Human 1: glad _to_ hear you're better . sorry _to_ hear [you] were _sick_ . [i] _was_ _sick_ a couple _of_ weeks ago [with] a bad cough . there's _definitely_ a bug [going] _around_ . admit [i] [just] _want to_ _stay healthy _for_ the holidays_ _and_ _plan_ _to relax_ . 
B|5| Human 2: ah , _definitely !_ [the holidays] are [just] [around] [the] corner [and] it's _great_ _that_ [you] [want [to] relax] [and] [stay healthy for] them . 
A|6| Human 1: [definitely _!] i_ [know] a lot _of_ folks travel _for the holidays_ , _but_ _i'm_ _happy_ [to] [stay] _home_ _myself_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: what's [your] [plan] [for the holidays] ? 
A|8| Human 1: _me_ _too_ . now _i have_ folks come visit _me_ [for the holidays] ! _but_ _that's_ _also_ tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [happy] coughing [and] staying [home] [with] [myself] [for the holidays] . [but] [have] [you] [been] [sick] [too] ? <|im 
A|10| Human 1: yes ! we set up an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas tree_ [and] _put_ up _some_ colorful led lights which is very _festive_ . 
B|11| Human 2: _nice_ [! i] [also] [put] [some] [festive] holiday-themed sticky notes [and] emojis [around] [the] [home] [for] _that_ extra special feel-good 
A|12| Human 1: buying a _tree_ is a neat _experience_ . [i] _was_ torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake _one_ vs . a real _one_ [that] smells [like] fresh _pine_ . in [the] end , we opted [for the] _one_ [that] we [can] disassemble _every year_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [how] [was] [that] [experience] [for] [you] ? [i have] [one] [every year] [and] [the] smell [of] [pine] always brings [me] back [to] christmas's past . [but] 
A|14| Human 1: [oh ,] very clever pun [! i] [like] it ! depends . [i] remember having real _christmas trees_ from _childhood_ , [but] these days [with] climate change , [i] think not chopping down a _tree_ [just] [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in a month is [the] more responsible thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: understood , [and] [i] [can] [definitely] imagine [the] smell [of] [pine] [trees] bringing back [childhood] memories . [christmas tree] farms [have] [also] [been] prom 
A|16| Human 1: admit my favorite store is _target_ , plus _they_ often [have] _good deals_ . 
B|17| Human 2: [target] [has] [good deals] [for] [christmas trees] ? [that's] _great_ [to] [know] ! [they] [have] [some] _nice_ artificial [trees] [that] [can] last [for] years [with] proper care 
A|18| Human 1: [great] , [i] hope [you] find a [nice] [tree] .
