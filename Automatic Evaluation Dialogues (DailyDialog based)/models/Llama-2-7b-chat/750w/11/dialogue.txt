Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can tell you about different types of flowers
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	Ah, the lotus flower! Yes, it's indeed a symbol of spiritual growth and renewal in many cultures. The lotus flower
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or the ability to form opinions, but I can provide information on flower
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	*chuckles* I think you're onto something with the lotus! Many people find that their flower preferences are reflected in their person
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	It's like you and I are on a flower personality revealing adventure! *excited twirling* ���
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 I'm glad you're excited! It's important to ask questions and get to know someone more over a period of time to develop
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
