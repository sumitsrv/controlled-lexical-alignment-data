A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can tell [you] about different types _of_ flowers 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working _on a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [the lotus] [flower] ! yes _, it's_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ spiritual growth _and_ renewal in many cultures . [the lotus] [flower] 
A|6| Human 1: oh [, it's] not research ! [just] [a] [personal] theory . _i think_ _that_ _flower preferences are_ _more_ _revealing_ [of] _personality_ than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai , [i] don't [have] [personal] [preferences] or [the] ability [to] form opinions , but [i] can provide information [on] [flower] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then it came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: *chuckles* [i think] you're onto something _with [the_ lotus] ! many [people] find [that] _their_ [flower preferences are] reflected in _their_ _person_ 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] _ask_ _someone_ what [their] favourite [flower] is . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [you] [and] [i] [are] [on a] [flower] [personality] [revealing] adventure ! *excited twirling* ��� 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with the] [person] some _more_ , [and] _ask_ them some _more_ _questions_ , [and] gradually _develop_ [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] glad you're excited ! [it's] important [to] [ask] [questions] [and] get [to] know [someone] [more] [over] [a] period [of] time [to] [develop] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
