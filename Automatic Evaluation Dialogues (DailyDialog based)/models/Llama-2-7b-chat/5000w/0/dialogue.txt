Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	That sounds like a great way to meet new people!  Do you have any favorite holiday traditions?
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	25? That's great! Maybe you can tell me one of your favorite holiday memories?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	Australia was one of my  favorite ones too! Maybe we can get you to come back and keep count for us this holiday season?<|
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	The people are what make it special and interesting.  Maybe one day we'll meet in person?
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 I'm just an AI and do not have a physical body or meet people in person. My purpose it to answer questions and provide information
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 That's fascinating. What are you and what do you do?
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	That's what it says on your treasure map
