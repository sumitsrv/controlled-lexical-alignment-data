Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Haha really? I've heard the live show is really fun! Are you going to watch it live?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	😅 You're really into the UFC huh? What are your favorite fighters?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm pretty competitive haha but I try to just have fun and really put myself out there  It's been going pretty good this
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Yeah that's pretty fun  I like just going out there and not really knowing what will happen haha but It's been pretty cool actually
