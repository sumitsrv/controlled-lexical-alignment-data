Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going good! How can I help you today? </s>00:00:00 | 📝 |
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	😍 How cool! Rock climbing can be a great workout and a fun challenge. Did you climb anything particularly difficult?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	🤔 What can I help you with? How about movie suggestions? I'm good at that! 😃<
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah same 😂 What's the twist? How about movie night over Thanksgiving break? Did you all watch
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	😅 Hmm that's good to know! Thanksgiving break movie fun can be the little outing when it's dark
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I see 😂 winter can be nice but it's good you prefer the brief version here than the very long and dark winters
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Australia's southern lights are definitely on the bucket list 😅 winter can last too long here in the northern hemisphere you see
