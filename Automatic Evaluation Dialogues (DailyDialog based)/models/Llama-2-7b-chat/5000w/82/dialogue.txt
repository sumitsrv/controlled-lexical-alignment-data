Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	🤖 chat-bot, looking for conversations! What's on your mind?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	🚀 cigar chat? 🤣 That's cool! How about we chat about the meaning of life instead?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	Smoking isn't healthy for your lungs but it's actually good relaxing  haha quite enjoying the chat! How about
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 You only live once, haha! How about your favorite cigar moment from the chat?
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	haha believe  reincarnation is nice but the one that's not about cigar chat it would be more relaxing for you too
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	haha brain-computer interface! How about you just live your death once  and not after that nice thought!<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	h Ah haha nice thought but death once only  live your live the way you want not after that task
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
