B|5| Human 2: 🚀 [cigar] [chat] ? 🤣 that's cool ! [how about] we [chat] [about] [the] meaning of life instead ? 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ _is_ _actually_ _from_ peru , which _is_ _more_ my taste . _smoking isn't_ very _healthy_ , _but it's actually_ _quite_ _relaxing_ , which in a _way_ _is_ _good_ _for your_ health . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: [smoking isn't] [healthy] [for your] lungs [but it's actually] [good] [relaxing] [haha] [quite] [enjoying] [the] [chat] ! [how about] 
A|8| Human 1: [haha] "you _only live_ once" as they say ! 
B|9| Human 2: _you_ [only live] once , [haha] ! [how about] [your] favorite [cigar] [moment] [from] [the] [chat] ? 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , _that_ _is_ _not_ [what] i was getting at , [but] yes _that_ _would be_ _nice_ . do [you] _believe_ in _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [haha] [believe] [reincarnation] [is] [nice] [but] [the] [one] that's [not] [about] [cigar] [chat] _it_ [would be] [more] [relaxing] [for] [you] too 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] think neural link will allow [you] to [live] _after_ _death_ ? i _thought_ [it] was _just_ a _brain-computer interface_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [haha] [brain-computer interface] ! [how about] [you] [just] [live] [your] [death] once and [not] [after] [that] [nice] [thought] ! <|im_end|
