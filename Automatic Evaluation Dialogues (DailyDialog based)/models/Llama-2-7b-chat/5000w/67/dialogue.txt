Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 Wow, that's quite an adventure! Are you feeling excited or nervous?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Seville is a great city! I've always wanted to visit Spain. What inspires you to skydive?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🙂 Yes, skydiving can be quite scary before you do it for the first time
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🙂 Yes, extreme sports can be very exciting for the adrenaline rush<
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI 🙂 Have you tried any water sports?
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	🙂 Haha that's great! I'm definitely the beginner class type for water sports and extreme skiing. How fast
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
