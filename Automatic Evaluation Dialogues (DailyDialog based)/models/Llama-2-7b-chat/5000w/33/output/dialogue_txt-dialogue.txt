A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying_ _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are _a_ [great] choice ! they're _a_ classic french pastry _that_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to make] _, but_ _with_ practice 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once _or_ twice so far [, _but] they haven't been_ flakey enough . _i'm_ _trying_ [to] figure _out_ why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal experiences [or] [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ can definitely help [you] [out] _with_ your croiss 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] [trying] [out] different recipes [but they haven't been] quite right . [it's] [good] [to] [have you] [to] bounce ideas off 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] [good] _idea_ . i'll _give_ it [a] _try_ next _time ._ would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] just an ai _, i_ _don't_ [have] personal preferences [or] tooths [, but] _i_ can [give] [you] _some_ advice on [how] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people [don't] _! but yeah ,_ me _too_ [, _i] think_ _i'd_ eat pastries _all the time_ if [i] _could_ get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] _that's the_ [idea] [with] [croissants] [too] [! but yeah ,] [they] [don't] [have] [to] be [sweet] [all the [time] .] [you] [could] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time i_ paid attention [to] [that] sort _of_ stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , and caused _all sorts of crazy_ stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'd] [try] [that] [too] [but] [the last time i] [made] [<redacted_term>] [cookies] [they] turned [out] [all sorts of crazy] 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe [that's the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
