Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 Sure, I'm interested! Can you tell me more about the volunteer opportunities and how I can sign up?<|im_
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	That sounds like a great opportunity! Can you send me the details and registration information for the volunteer positions?<|im_<|im_
