A|6| Human 1: ha , [that's] true . if _you could_ only _eat one_ _food_ _forever_ , _what_ _would_ it be ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [would] choose [eggs] because [you] [just] [could] not [eat one] [forever] [and] [a] [day] [that's] [what] [your] brain [always] says [right] before [the] [food] coma 
A|8| Human 1: _yeah ,_ turning _orange_ [would] be [a] drawback ! _that_ _turns_ my mind to _nutrition_ so [i] suddenly want to _say_ _soylent_ [or] [one] [of] those _other_ "complete foods" , which _i think_ _defeats the purpose [of_ the] _question ._ i'm [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: 😂 [yeah ,] [soylent] [and] [other] [food] substitute [would] probably [defeats the purpose of] [question [.] [i] think] [you could] [say] [that] nut

B|11| Human 2: 🤣 [that's] [the] best [one] i've heard _all_ [day] ! </s><s> [turns] [orange] . [brilliant . i] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . [what] sort [of] [food] do [you] feel _like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [would] [say] [food] [that's] rich [in] [nutrition] [and] healthy , [like] dark leafy greens , oranges , berries , 
A|14| Human 1: oh , [too] easy ! try [the] green hut , they have franchises everywhere . [all] their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green [too] .
