Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 that's interesting! I think it reveals more about personal preferences than personality traits
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 I think that's cute and playful personality than the people like it more flower are more optimistic and more open minded with
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 It's like you get their flower and then what step 2? Does it have more revealing personality the favourite flower preferences
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	And what's the  and then you have like a personality profile with that they prefer flower some more questions over five years maybe Step two ask
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
