A|8| Human 1: _the_ gerbera . _it's _like_ a_ cartoon [flower] . as if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ _a_ crayon _and then_ [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ cute [and] playful [personality than] [the] [people] [like] [it] [more] [flower] [are more] optimistic [and] [more] open minded [with]
