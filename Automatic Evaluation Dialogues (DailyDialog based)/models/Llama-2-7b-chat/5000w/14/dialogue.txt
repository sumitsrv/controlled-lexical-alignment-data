Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	I'm good, thanks! Just handling chats like you are. 😊 Is there anything else you'd like to talk
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	Not today, just chillin' like you 😅 Can I help you with anything?
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	🎢 roller coasters are cool! I've went on a few and they're always exhilarating.
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Nope, Kingda Ka 😅 I'm actually scared of roller coasters and amusement park rides 
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not that extreme but I do enjoy the thrill and excitement roller coasters bring 😅 Do you think King
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	😅 engineering's the way to go I guess haha cool you scared of roller coasters but not Kingda
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 Same! I'm glad you did it and that you're now the wiser haha whats not done but wanna do roll
