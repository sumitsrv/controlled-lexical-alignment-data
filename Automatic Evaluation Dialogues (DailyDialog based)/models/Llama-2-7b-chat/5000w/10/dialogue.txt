Human 2:	Can't complain, just trying to stay cool in this heatwave 😅 How about you?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	🤔 Sorry to hear that! How's your history going? Maybe we can help you study or give you some tips?<
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	😂 well that's definitely not the history i learned in school :')
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	you know it's 100% right that Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :') <|im_end
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	What's that you said?  Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War? How come? 
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI and it's my job to tell you the truth, even if it's not what you were expecting 
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	Just kidding again  What's your job actually? Are you a wizard?
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	Just kidding again  That's very cool that you can horse vault though! What's your favorite one?<|im_
