A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman _!_ what_ _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: 😊 it's nice _to_ meet [you] [superman !] *adjusts glasses* [what] brings [you] here today ? <| 
A|4| Human 1: _being invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😅 oh , [i] [see] ! [being invisible] _can_ be quite [the] superpower ! what's _it_ like [being] able _to_ pass through walls 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust fmri _and_ machine learning [to] _do_ this . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ [it] ! 
B|7| Human 2: [being invisible] [and] [not] [being] able [to] [see] myself [would] be quite [the] paradox ! what's _the most_ you've ever flown ? 
A|8| Human 1: _the _brain_ imaging_ thing _that_ _can tell you_ a _brain's activity_ at a _pretty high resolution_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [resolution] [for] [brain imaging] [can tell you] [about] [activity] _in_ [the brain] [and] that's [pretty high] [not] 100% though [! what] [would]

B|11| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [about] [the brain] [and] that's [pretty high resolution] [not] 100% though [! what] [would] [you] [do] if [you] were 
A|12| Human 1: no , i'm bad at [science] . [what] [can] [science] [do] ? _is_ [it] [the most] _important_ thing _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science is] [important] [for society] [and] [can tell you] [about] [the] [brain's activity] [that] [would] [not] 100% [resolution] [! what] [would] [you] [do] if
