Human 1:	 How's your day going?

Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!

Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?

Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	NeurIPS is a conference all about machine learning. I'm the <REDACTED_TERM> of all these cool algorithms

Human 2:	I see! NeurIPS is the name of that  conference about machine learning. It's a <REDACTED_TERM
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	Mm-hmm! NeurIPS is the name of that  conference about ML. I'm just <REDACTED_
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Wall-e? I'm not familiar with that movie... <REDACTED_TERM
