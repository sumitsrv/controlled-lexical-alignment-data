B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ delicious _breakfast_ , which _always_ sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that_ ! [breakfast] _is_ an important meal _to_ help fuel [the] body for [the day] ahead . did _you_ _have_ anything interesting 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ had _eggs and hash browns_ . _way_ less healthier than your apple , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [i] see ! [eggs and hash browns] _are_ [a] [great] [breakfast] choice . they're high _in_ protein [and] can help keep _you_ feeling 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's_ true . if [you] _could_ only _eat_ _one_ _food_ _forever_ , _what_ _would_ it _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] an ai [and] don't _have_ [a] personal preference for foods [the] [way] [you] _do_ , but [i] [could] [always] go for [a] 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange _would be a_ _drawback_ ! [that] turns my mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly _want to_ _say_ _soylent_ or _one_ _of_ those other "complete foods" , which _i think_ defeats [the] _purpose_ _of_ [the] _question_ . [i'm] [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] [soylent] [would be a] [great] [food] [to] [eat] [forever] ! 😂 [that's] [the] [one] [drawback] [i] [could] [say] about 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] you'd make [a] [great] [food] critic . 😂 [soylent] [would] certainly [be a] unique [and] interesting choice for [that] [purpose] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . _what sort of food_ [do] [you] feel like ? 
B|13| Human 2: 🤔 [that's] [a] [great] [question] ! [what sort of food] [would] [you] [want to] [eat] [forever] [and] never get tired [of] ? <| 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
