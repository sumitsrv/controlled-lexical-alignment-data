Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! How can I help you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Rock climbing can be a really fun and challenging activity. How was your experience this weekend?<|
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	It's nice to have some good movie recommendations. What are your favorites?<|
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah nice  twists and turns! Lots of good movie recommendations over the break? How was your weekend?<|<
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Hmm good question  can rock climbing and running be fun together? What's the best outfit for it?<|<<|im_
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	've been here all  the time actually are you from originally? I was over winter but not fun like going out and about more when it'
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Ah I see nice  twists and turns! Lots of good movie recommendations over the break are you from originally should definitely try visit Australia once
