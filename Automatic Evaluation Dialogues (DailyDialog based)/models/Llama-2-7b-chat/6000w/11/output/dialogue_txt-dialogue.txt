B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you _have_ a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ _just_ an ai , _i_ [have] no _personal_ _preferences_ , but _i_ can certainly help [you] _with_ flower-related queries ! how can 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] asked ! [the lotus] _flower is_ indeed [a] symbol _of_ [spring] _and_ renewal in many cultures _. it's_ [a] symbol 
A|6| Human 1: oh , [it's] not research _! just_ [a] [personal] theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] _preferences are more_ _revealing_ [of] _personality_ _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] you're onto something there [! just] [the] other day , [a] friend [of] mine [revealing] [that] [preferences are more] [than] [just] [personal] t 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ [. _it's] like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the gerbera] [does] [have a] playful [and] cartoonish appearance , doesn't [it] ? [it] could indeed reveal [more] [than] [personality] prefer 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ _someone_ what _their_ favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . [does] [that] _make_ sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's like] [you have] [their] [personality] [preferences] [and] [it] [just] [revealing] [more] [than] [that] ! [i think] [the lotus] [flower] could [make] [someone] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk with_ [the] person some [more] , _and ask them_ some [more] _questions_ , [and] _gradually develop_ [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and] _that's_ [the gerbera] [flower] [personality] [the] [more] [you] [talk with] [someone] [and ask them] [questions] [over] time , [like] [gradually develop] [their] character
