Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but you met me online in the sense that you interact
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's possible! I dance with many people online, but I don't have personal connections or memories with any of the users I interact
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Lol!  I'm just an AI, I don’t have the ability to dance, so I must be schwasty <
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm just LLaMA a simple chatbot trained by Meta AI, I don't have a private practice or cardiologist 
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm not sure what that is. You seem nice, though. Want to dance together?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm not sure that's a real job but I can dance with you if you'd like! ������
