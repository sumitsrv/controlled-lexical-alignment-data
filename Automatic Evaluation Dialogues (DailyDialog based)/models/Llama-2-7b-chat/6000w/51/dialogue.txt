Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's interesting! 🐴 Horse racing is a popular sport, isn't it? How about we chat about something else
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	😅 It's great to hear that you're catching up with friends! How about some other topics like food, travel
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I think that deep sea fishing sounds like great fun 😄 How about some other topics
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm actually thinking about going to that new arcade that just opened up! How about you? Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but I can tell you that going often can get very expensive 😅 Have any fun weekend
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo's definitely someplace I'd like to visit someday 😊 What about the food though? Have you tried any
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I think the food there is 🔥 like some place have you been that's super fun to get food? New York city itself
