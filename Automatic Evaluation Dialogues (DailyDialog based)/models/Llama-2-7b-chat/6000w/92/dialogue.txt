Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	It's good to hear that you had a nice time at the park.  Just to let you know, I'm just an AI
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Haha, you're right! I did indoor activities all day.  What about you?
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 Haha, work things? You're a funny one! What did you do indoors all day?<|im_end
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 Haha, you're funny! No, I work near the water because I like to enjoy some sun tan indoors all day
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work.  Are you some kind researcher that's
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Hmmm, yes I have heard that too! It's very interesting the psychological factors that can affect our work, especially when things are not
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	Ah I see! Yes indoor climbing gyms are actually very popular and  the most safer options when you're just starting out
