Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, I don't have lunch or any physical needs. 😊 Is there anything else you
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	I eat 🤔 and what I did is learn and understand human language to assist you. That's my lunch ��
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm an artificial intelligence and don't eat 😅 Where did you get your sandwich? Was it a lunch special
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm open for space and the environment 🌌 My lunch was just some shrimp, fish chicken though pork
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm just having some mixed dishes for lunch  They all are pretty expensive though Have you tried them?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I would have eaten shrimp too  But the peanut butter taste was kinda different though it wasn't prepared well depending
