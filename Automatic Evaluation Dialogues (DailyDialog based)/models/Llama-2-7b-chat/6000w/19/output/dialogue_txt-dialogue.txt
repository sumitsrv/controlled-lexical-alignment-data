B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman _!_ _what_ about you ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: 😊 [what] _a_ cool superhero [you] are ! 🦸‍♂️ _would_ [you] like _to_ chat [about] [the] latest 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] _won't_ see me . 
B|5| Human 2: 😉 you're [the] [invisible] [superman !] that's really cool [! what] powers _would_ [you] like _to_ have ? <|im 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would rather _trust fmri_ and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: m you're [not] [the] [invisible] [superman] [you] [trust fmri and machine learning] [for] [that] [would] be really something _. [what_ about you ?] [what] 
A|8| Human 1: _the _brain_ imaging thing_ [that] _can tell you_ [a] brain's activity at [a] pretty _high_ _resolution_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [can] [you] [tell] [that] [this] thing's [brain imaging] [resolution] [for] [superman] [would] [not] be [high] [and] [the] [machine learning] algorithms [won't] _make_ [invisible] 
A|10| Human 1: _i believe in_ _science_ ! _science_ is my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [and machine learning] are amazing [god] 🤖 can't [believe] [you] [would rather trust fmri] [that] [brain imaging _thing] for_ 
A|12| Human 1: no , i'm bad at [science] [. what] [can] [science] do ? is it _the most important thing for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [the most important thing for society] what's happening [in] [the brain] [that] [invisible] [superman] [i believe in] [fmri and machine]
