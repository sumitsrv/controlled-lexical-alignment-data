A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ _delicious_ breakfast , which always sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ [great] _to_ hear ! _is_ there anything else [i] can help _you_ with today ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i had_ _eggs and hash browns_ . _way_ less healthier than your apple _, _i'm_ afraid_ ! 
B|5| Human 2: haha [, i'm] sure [eggs and hash browns] _are_ [delicious] as well ! _do you_ _have_ any plans for [the day] ? <|im 
A|6| Human 1: ha , [that's] true . _if you could only eat one_ _food_ forever , what _would_ it be ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm afraid] [i] [would] miss [a] variety _of_ foods _too_ much ! but [if] [i had] _to_ choose [just] [one] ... [eggs] ! <|im_ 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange [would] be [a] drawback ! _that_ turns my mind [to] nutrition _so_ [i] suddenly want [to] say _soylent_ _or_ [one] [of] those other "complete foods" , which _i think_ defeats [the] purpose [of] [the] question . [i'm] in [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] you're muddled ? [or] perhaps [that] [would] [just] make [a] very interesting [food] conversation ! [soylent] _is_ certainly [one] option , [and] 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] _love_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] you'd make [a] [great] chef , by [the] [way] ! _do you_ _have_ any favorite recipes [to] share ? <|im_end| 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort [of] [food] [do you] _feel like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [would] [love] [to] learn about [the] foods you'd [feel like] missing [if you could only eat one] thing ! [that's] [so] fun ! 
A|14| Human 1: oh , [too] easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green [too] .
