Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's great to hear! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Haha, I'm sure eggs and hash browns are delicious as well! Do you have any plans for the day?<|im
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I'm afraid I would miss a variety of foods too much! But if I had to choose just one... eggs!<|im_
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I think you're muddled? Or perhaps that would just make a very interesting food conversation! Soylent is certainly one option, and
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I think you'd make a great chef, by the way! Do you have any favorite recipes to share?<|im_end|
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I would love to learn about the foods you'd feel like missing if you could only eat one thing! That's so fun!
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
