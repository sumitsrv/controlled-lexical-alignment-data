Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	Ah, Avatar! Yes, it's a classic. I really enjoyed "The Matrix" last year. Have you seen it?<|
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	Oh, I see! Yes, it's a thought-provoking movie that raises important questions about our relationship with nature. I also enjoy
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?

Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
