A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , _thanks_ . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] ! they're definitely one _of_ _the_ more challenging _pastries_ [to make] _, but_ _with_ _a_ little practice _and_ patience , 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once or twice _so_ far [, but] they haven't been flakey enough . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why _. what kind of_ cookies _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: well , [i've] [made] _a_ variety [of] [them] . chocolate chip , oatmeal raisin , peanut butter ... 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: _yeah ,_ [i've] noticed _that_ _too_ . _it_ can be _a_ bit tricky [to] _get_ [them] right [. what kind of] tips [have you] come across for making 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] good idea . _i'll_ _give it a try next time ._ would [you] say [you] [have] [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to] [give it a try next time .] [thanks] for _the_ tip ! 
A|10| Human 1: _some people_ _don't_ ! [but] [yeah ,] me [too] , _i_ _think_ i'd _eat_ [pastries] _all_ [the] [time] _if_ _i_ could [get] away [with] [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] [think] [so] ! [it's] important [to] [have] fun _and_ _enjoy_ [the] process [of] baking , even [if] [you] [don't] [eat] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] _i_ paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts [of] _crazy_ stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] know , right ? [it's] [crazy] [how] [some people] can [eat] [<redacted_term>] [all] day _and not_ gain weight 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] [enjoy] sweets [and not] feel guilty 🙂
