Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Ah, croissants! They're definitely one of the more challenging pastries to make, but with a little practice and patience,
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	Well, I've made a variety of them. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter...
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	Yeah, I've noticed that too. It can be a bit tricky to get them right. What kind of tips have you come across for making
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'll have to give it a try next time. Thanks for the tip!
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! It's important to have fun and enjoy the process of baking, even if you don't eat
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I know, right? It's crazy how some people can eat <REDACTED_TERM> all day and not gain weight
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
