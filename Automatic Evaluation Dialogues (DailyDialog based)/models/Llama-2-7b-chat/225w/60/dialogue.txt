Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	It's going well, thanks for asking! What can I help you with?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	That's great! Rock climbing can be a really fun and challenging activity. Did you find it to be mentally and physically demand
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Sure thing! Do you want to chat about movies?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Hahah, nice! So what's the plot of that movie?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Yeah, it's definitely a good workout!
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I'm from the southern part of the northern hemisphere. It's very cold and dark here, but I like it that way!
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Yes 😅 I've been practicing my Australian accent and it's definitely a funny thing to try to imitate
