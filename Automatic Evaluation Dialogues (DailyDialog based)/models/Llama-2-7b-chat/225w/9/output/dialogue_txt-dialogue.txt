A|4| Human 1: [glad _to] hear_ _you're_ better . _sorry to hear_ _you were sick_ . [i] was _sick_ _a_ couple _of_ weeks ago [with] _a_ bad cough . _there's_ _definitely_ _a_ bug [going] around . admit [i] _just_ want [to] stay healthy [for] _the holidays_ _and_ plan _to relax_ . 
B|5| Human 2: _oh_ no , _i'm_ [sorry to hear] _that_ [you were sick] _too_ ! 😞 _yes_ , _it_ [definitely] feels _like_ [there's] [been] 
A|6| Human 1: [definitely] ! _i know_ _a lot of_ folks travel [for] _the holidays_ [, but i'm] happy [to] stay _home_ myself ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] staying [home] [and] cooking [a] big meal [for] _my_ family [and] friends . it's [going] [to] be [a lot of] fun ! 
A|8| Human 1: me [too] . [now] [i] _have_ folks come visit me [for] _the holidays !_ [but] that's also tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i know] , right ? 😅 [but] it's always _nice_ [to] [have] _some_ time [to relax] [and] spend [with] [the] people [you] care about 
A|10| Human 1: [yes] ! we set up _an_ eco-friendly (i . e . fake) christmas tree [and] put up [some] colorful led _lights_ which is very festive . 
B|11| Human 2: _oh ,_ _that_ sounds _like_ [a lot of] fun ! [i'm] sure [you] [and] [your] family [have] [a] _great_ time during [the holidays !] � 
A|12| Human 1: buying [a] tree is [a] neat _experience_ . [i] was torn between buying _an_ artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one [that] _smells like fresh pine_ . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] one [that] we [can] disassemble every year . 
B|13| Human 2: 🤖 [i'm] [just] [an] ai [and] _do_ _not_ [have] [the] ability [to] [experience] [holidays] or [smells like fresh pine] 
A|14| Human 1: [oh ,] very clever pun ! [i] [like] [it] ! depends . [i] remember having real christmas trees from childhood [, but] these days [with] climate change , _i think_ [not] chopping down [a] tree [just] [to] decorate [it] [and] then throw [it] out in [a] month is [the] more responsible thing [to] [do] . 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [an] ai [and] [do] [not] [have] [the] ability [to] [experience] [holidays] 😅 [yes] , [you're] right . 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store is _target_ , plus they often [have] _good deals_ . 
B|17| Human 2: [i think] [target] [and] ikea [have] [some] [good deals] [for] decorations [and] [lights] 💡
