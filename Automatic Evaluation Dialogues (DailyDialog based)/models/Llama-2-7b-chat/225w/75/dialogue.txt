Human 2:	😂 I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to get schwasty or experience the physical world
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?

Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm not sure what that is either! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or know much about medical
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
