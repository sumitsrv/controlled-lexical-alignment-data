Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Yes, I do! I love sunflowers.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	Ah, the lotus! Yes, that's a beautiful flower too. It's actually a symbol of spiritual growth and transformation in many cult
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	Ah, I see! Well, it's always interesting to think about the psychology behind people's preferences. Do you have any other
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	(chuckles) Oh, that's an interesting one! Yes, gerbera flowers do have a very vibrant and cheerful
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	The flower you like says a lot about your personality! It's like, if you like sunflowers, you are optimistic and loyal
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	(smiling) And that's how you can use the flower they like as a starting point to understand their personality more and more over time
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
