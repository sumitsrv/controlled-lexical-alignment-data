Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Oh, I've been good! Just got back from a walk with my dog. It was so nice outside today. How about you?<
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! It's great to have some time to yourself to relax and recharge. How long had you been friends
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm sure you'll have a great time! It can be quite relaxing, just you and the sea. How about I get<
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually thinking of going on a bike ride. It's such nice weather, I can't resist. Have you been on
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	It is? I'm surprised! I though you would be more into the beach. Have you been
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo is a great city! I've always wanted to visit there. What brings you there? Are there any specific sights you want to see
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! New York is such an iconic city with so much to see and do. Would you like some recommendations
