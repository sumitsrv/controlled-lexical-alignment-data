B|11| Human 2: it's great [that] [you] [trust] [science] 🔬 [and] [brain imaging] technology like [fmri] [for] understanding [the brain] [activity] . [the] field 
A|12| Human 1: no , [i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] _most_ important thing [for] _society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [and] [the] study of [brain imaging] like [fmri] contribute significantly [to] society's well-being .
