A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is it _raining_ pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ language model and do not _have_ real-time _weather_ capabilities . _to_ find out if it's [raining] 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... _i don't_ _like_ them too much . they _make days gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , so [i don't] experience [the] _weather_ [like] [rain] [that] _can_ [make days gloomy] . however , [i] 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ _water trouble_ too ... 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , so [i don't] _have_ [the] capability _to_ "grow up" or experience [water trouble] [like] 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ ... [i don't] _think_ _i can_ survive _in_ [that] [weather] _ever_ _. just_ [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] _me_ want [to] sit _in_ _heated rroms_ 
B|9| Human 2: indeed , [the] [weather] can't [trouble] an _ai_ [like] [me] [that] exists [in] digital form [. just] [think] , [rain] [water] or [heated rroms] 
A|10| Human 1: people say there is drought _here_ ... _but_ we _have 24 hours_ _water supply here_ ... lol ... never seen [that] [in] _a_ drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [haha] , that's [the] beauty [of] being [here] ! [i can] [have 24 hours] [supply] [but] [don't] [ever] [think] [water] rationing 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn interesting . did _you_ _see_ it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] [have] drastic impacts on [water supply here] on [the] planet [but] that's [a] problem [you] [don't] [see] hanging around 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking about how [ai] is helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
