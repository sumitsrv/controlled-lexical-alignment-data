Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't experience days or work in the traditional sense, but I'm fully operational and ready to assist you
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?

Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	I'm flattered by your imaginative analogy! While I can't run marathons or half-marathons myself
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
