Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm glad to hear that! A well-rounded breakfast can certainly give a great start. What did you have for breakfast today? 
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I'm just a digital assistant and don't eat breakfasts, but your eggs and hash browns sound delicious! They're great
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I'm a food and breakfasts one would only eat the apple that you're always mentioning. 😄 It could add
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I'm just a computer program and foods are only one aspect of the question you want to discuss. Soylent would be nutrition
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	So true! I'm all about the nutrition and health aspects which you rightly pointed out. 
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	That depends entirely on the health and nutrition you'd like to discuss:
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
