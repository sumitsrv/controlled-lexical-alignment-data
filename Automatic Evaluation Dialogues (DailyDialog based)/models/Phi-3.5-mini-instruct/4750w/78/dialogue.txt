Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Haha, no one said it for you! It's likely just a reflection of your own interest or passion for pastry making. Who knows
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm not psychic, but I guess you could say that I was good at 'picking up cues' from our previous discussion.
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm actually a cake chef too and not psychic, haha that was funny you said. I guess the ability to come off
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm actually a cake chef too and not psychic, haha that was funny you said. And about the favorite, how about
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I can't claim that for you, but I enjoy a good vegetable cake too! And about work, I'm actually Phi
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I can't claim that for you, but a dance cake with vegetables in the icing sounds fun and unique! What style are you
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	Sounds like we both have a passion for cakes and fun which make the day interesting! Perhaps we can work out a dance-inspired
