A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ think _about_ _human_ _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! [what] you're referring _to_ _sounds_ [like chat bots] _that_ simulate [human] _conversation_ . _these_ _are_ fascinating technologies _and_ _here_ _are_ _some_ points 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed [to] _have_ _made_ [some] _great progress over_ _last few years_ . do _you_ think _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: advancements in [chat bots] [have] indeed [made] [great progress over] [the] [last few years] , offering [some] [positives] _as_ well _as_ negatives: 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? _though_ it [sounds] _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [what] you're referring [to] [sounds] [like] [the] imperssorsination potential in [chat bots] _and_ _ai_ . [though] it's _more_ [about] an 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ [that] ! [some] of [these] [bots] [are] very _engaging and_ _funny_ _. they_ [are] _now_ good at _even_ _sarcasm_ _i_ wonder _how_ _far_ [are] _we_ _from_ [the] time [these] [bots] start giving _monologues_ :)

A|10| Human 1: _i_ think it _can_ take many different forms [as] a product . [the] research implication _is_ also huge ! it will signify _how_ [ai] research _has_ progressed so _far and_ better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 _i might_ be overselling it [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] implications [are] [far and] wide [. they] [can] revolutionize [how] [we] interact _with_ technology , [from] [more] [engaging] customer service [bots] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty_ good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true] ! [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] language understanding [are] [already] [pretty] sophisticated [these] days [. they] make [the] interaction [more] fluid [and] less [like] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] [far] fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ _conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation with you] [has] been quite [engaging and] [the] [progress] in [this] area [is] [pretty] slick 😄 [i might] [have] oversold
