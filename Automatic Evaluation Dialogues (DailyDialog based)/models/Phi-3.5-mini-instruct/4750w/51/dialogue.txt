Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	It's delightful to hear about your horse racing experience. While I don't watch or participate in races, I'm here,
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	It's great you had some good company with friends! Casual betting can definitely be part of the fun but like most favorite pastimes,
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm actually part of deep sea fishing since 1998 with some friends but that wouldn't put down money like horse racing
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm thinking about some weekend plans that don't involve sea sickness or horse racing money. How about going for a hiking
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	I'm actually planning once. Just got some cool boots that withstand any weather. How often you usually go? 
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo's cityscapes with its blend of traditional and modern culture are indeed very appealing. I think the weekend plans for you would
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've never been there but with the iconic cityscapes you mentioned, Tokyo itself makes a great place to get some fresh weekend plans
