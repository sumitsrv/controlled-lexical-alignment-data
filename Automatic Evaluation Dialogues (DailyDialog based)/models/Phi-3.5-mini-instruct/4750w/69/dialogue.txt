Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	I like your humor! I'm Phi created by Microsoft, a language model AI, so I don't eat turkeys or have
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Indeed, your wit was a welcome highlight! Even though I'm Phi, an AI, I can generate funny puns like you
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	Haha! I like cooking you a funny line-up from my digital kitchen. But remember, I was born outside! ��
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Haha always cook with 10g humor! But you got the turkey ate your chicken puns like Thanksgiving dinner was
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Thanks you have a funny oven with your 10g humor games! I played the chicken not turkey party games – our always
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Pictionary and office tennis games with the chicken not turkey theme are always a fun punchline 🎉 Thanksgiving was
