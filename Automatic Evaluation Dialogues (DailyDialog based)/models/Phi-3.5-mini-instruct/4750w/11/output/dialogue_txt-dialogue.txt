B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an ai , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or [favourite] things . however , _i_ can provide [you] _with_ information about popular or commonly 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ _to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ often [the] [spring] _that_ comes [to mind] in various cultural , psychological _, and_ literary contexts due [to] its rich symbolism _and_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! just _a_ [personal] theory . [i] think [that] _flower preferences_ are _more_ _revealing_ _of_ _personality_ _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] personality-driven , but [it's] true [that] [people] [have a] lot [more] [than] [personal] [preferences] [revealing] about themselves . 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then it came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] sorry for [the] misunderstanding . [the gerbera] [does] [have a] cartoonish [and] vibrant [personality] [with] its colorful pet 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their_ [favourite] [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we just did . [does] [that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] understand [that] you're trying [to] [make _sense] of_ [the] [flower preferences] [and] [their] possible symbolism . [the gerbera] , [with] its vibr 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] [, and] ask them some _more questions_ [, and] _gradually_ develop [a] [sense of] what they're _like_ , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] see [the] step-by-step approach [. it's like] [gradually] [and] carefully [revealing] [personality] [with] [more questions] [over] time
