A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think _about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _as_ an _ai_ language model , _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts , but _i_ _can_ provide [you] _with_ _some_ insights [about] human-like 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ [some] _great_ _progress_ _over_ last few _years_ . do [you] think _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] development _of_ human-like chatbots [over] recent [years] _has_ indeed been significant , bringing _a_ mix _of_ [positives] _and_ [negatives] 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though _it sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [it sounds] [like] you're referring [to] [the] concept _of_ imperssorsination , _a_ playful twist _on the_ word "personalization . " 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] [of] these bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny _. _they_ are now_ good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how _far_ _are_ we _from_ [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are now] sophisticated enough [to] engage in witty exchanges [and] [some] [even] [have] programming [that] mimics emotional intelligence . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think [it] [can] take _many_ different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication _is_ also huge ! [it] will signify how [ai] research [has] progressed so _far and_ _better_ place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [progress] [has] implications [far and] wide , [from] [better] human-computer interaction [to] [the] potential impact [on] [many] industries [that] [can] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty_ good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: indeed , [auto-suggestions] [and] conversational [ai] [have] [already] [made] impressive leaps [. they] [can] [now] understand [the] context [better] , remember past 
A|14| Human 1: haha , _pretty_ [far] fetched 🙂 nice _having_ this _conversation_ [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [you] [and] [i] [are] [having] [here] [is] quite sophisticated [already] ! [i] [can] process [and] understand your requests [pretty] well . it's [great]
