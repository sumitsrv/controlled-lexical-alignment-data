Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	That sounds amazing! I bet the slopes were just magical. Which ski resort did you visit? 
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	Oh no, that sounds like an adventurous but perhaps hazardous ice wall slide! I'm glad you got back on your feet
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	That's quite impressive and you managed that ice wall trip too! For any french you remember, just hit me with any words or phr
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Montreal is a bilingual city and french is widely spoken here. Here's a simple phrase you can use:

Human 2:	I'm Phi, and though I don't watch the Olympics, I can certainly help you with any Olympic-related information or French phr
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and just to clarify, my aim isn't to pull myself along the sides but to provide information or assistance. If
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I apologize for any confusion. As Phi, I'm Phi and I can assist you with a wide range of inquiries.
