Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have personal preferences, feelings, or favorites. However,
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	The lotus flower (Nelumbo nucifera) is a powerful symbol in several cultures and the spring mind you're referring to
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not a person, but that's a creative theory! In the context of human preferences, you are right
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and not human, so I don't have personal preferences like you might have with crayon cartoon flowers.
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and not human, so I don't have personal preferences like you might with crayon cartoon flowers. But
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	It's like gradually and over the course of much more than two years you develop a sense of their personality and preferences based on interactions and
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
