A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: how's your day going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _busy_ , lots _of_ _work_ _to_ finish up . _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai , _so_ _i_ don't [work] or experience [busy] periods , but i'm here and ready [to] help 
A|4| Human 1: _a_ couple projects _that_ [i] am trying [to] finish up before thanksgiving 🙂 do _you_ _have_ any _fun_ _plans_ _for_ _the_ _break_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: while [i] don't [have] [plans] or [break] experiences , i'm programmed with [the] ability [to] assist [you] anytime . here's something [fun] 
A|6| Human 1: haha xd [so] what do [you] _like_ [to] do _for_ [fun] ? 
B|7| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence _, i_ don't [have] [the] ability [to] engage in [fun] [like] [a] human does . however , i'm equipped [to] 
A|8| Human 1: cool ! i've started [to] _run_ [a] bit [as] well _not_ long _distances_ _though_ , _just_ [a] couple miles 
B|9| Human 2: i'm [just] phi , an ai [so] [the] concept _of running_ [as] [fun] isn't applicable [to] me . 
A|10| Human 1: haha 
B|11| Human 2: [i] understand [the] playful nature [of] [that] response . even [though] i'm phi , [the] ai , i'm here 24/ 
A|12| Human 1: [i] [like] [to] do long _distances_ . [i] [have] _run_ [a] few _marathons_ . 
B|13| Human 2: i'm phi , an artificial intelligence . while [i] cannot [run] [marathons] in [the] physical sense _, i_ can certainly help [you] with information , 
A|14| Human 1: no . _not_ this year . this _is_ _my_ _half-marathon_ year . instead [of _running] _marathons_ [,_ i] [run] one _half-marathon_ every month . 
B|15| Human 2: i'm phi , an artificial intelligence , and [running marathons] [is] [not] within [my] capabilities . however [, i] can simulate [half-marathon] 
A|16| Human 1: _two days ago_ . it was [a] tough one . 
B|17| Human 2: i'm phi [, i] can't [run] [marathons ,] but [i] can simulate [distances] [for] training purposes . [two days ago] [, i] processed
