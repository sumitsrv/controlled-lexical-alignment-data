B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think about human _like_ chat bots ?

A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ [some] great _progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . do [you] think [the] _positives_ outweigh [the] _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] development _of_ human-like chatbots [over] [the] [last few years] _has_ been substantial . _here_ _are_ [some] [positives] _and_ [negatives] 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ _impersorsination_ ? though it _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] _a_ concept _that_ blends [the] persistence _of_ human-like chatbots _with_ [the] vast data processing capabilities . 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ [that] ! [some] [of] these bots [are] very _engaging_ [and] funny _. _they_ are_ _now_ good at even _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how _far_ [are] we _from_ [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] indeed progressing [and] [the] [sarcasm] [you] mention _is_ [now] becoming quite sophisticated due [to] advances in natural language understanding . [some] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think it [can] take many different forms [as] [a] product _. the_ _research_ implication [is] also huge ! it will signify how [ai] _research_ [has] progressed so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 [i] might _be_ overselling it [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] [progress] [made] [from] [research] [and] development [has] [the] potential [to] [be] monumental [. the] implications stretch [far] beyond chatbots [. they] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂

A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this _conversation_ [with] [you] !
