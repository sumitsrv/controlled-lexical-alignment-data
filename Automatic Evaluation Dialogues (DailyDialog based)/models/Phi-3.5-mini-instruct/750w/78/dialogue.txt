Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Haha, no one said that directly to me! It seems you have the spark of passion for something creative and delicious. Perhaps you'
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	Whoa, I'm not psychic, but I do love a good guess that makes you giggle! I'm designed to engage
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I have a good understanding that I am not actually capable of psychic powers, and I'm glad you find the conversation light-hearted!
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about the sweet and the funny side of things too, even if I don't have a palate to enjoy cake
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm a chatbot and that means my work involves processing text for you! And while I can't enjoy food, I enjoy the fun
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I don't dance, instead, I have 1s and 0s that are a part of a unique dance – the digital dance!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I'm like the 24/7 bakery of a computer lab, churning out endless coded desserts!
