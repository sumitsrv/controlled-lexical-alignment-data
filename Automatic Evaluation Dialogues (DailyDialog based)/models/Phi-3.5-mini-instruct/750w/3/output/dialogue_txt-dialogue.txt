A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , so _i don't_ _have_ access _to_ real-time data or _weather_ updates . _to_ find out if 
A|4| Human 1: surprising that _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] like them _too_ much . they make days gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and while [i don't] _have_ [the] ability _to_ check live _weather_ information , [rain] certainly has _a_ way _of_ changing [the] atmosphere 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots [of] _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , urban rainwater management _can_ be _a_ challenging topic _in_ [the] context [of] water-dependent urban ecosystems . 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive [in] that [weather] ever . just [the] rains at 50 degrees make me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , and can't feel [weather] . _but_ let's _talk_ _about_ [water] impacts on urban areas . 
A|10| Human 1: people say _there_ is drought here ... [but] we [have] 24 hours [water] supply here ... lol ... never seen that [in] [a] drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [i] understand [the] lighter approach [to] [weather] discussion [but] let's dive deeper into water-dependent urban ecosystems . 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . climate change [talk] this morning _was_ pretty darn _interesting_ . did you see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [interesting] indeed , [but] you're right , [there] [was] [talk] _about_ [water] [in] [the] ecosystems [too] . rising sea levels , increased rainf 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking [about] how [ai] is helping climate change . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
