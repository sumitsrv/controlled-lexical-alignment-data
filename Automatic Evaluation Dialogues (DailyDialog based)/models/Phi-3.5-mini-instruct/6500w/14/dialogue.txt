Human 2:	Oh, that's amazing and interesting you are actually amusement park roller coaster first-timer! Just like how algorithms work for me
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Kingda Ka was a thrill! Just like the first time you'll encounter and learn how to process a new dataset or algorithm that's
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not wired that way but the world of amusement park rides and roller coasters are quite fascinating. Just
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	I'm all trust but not the roller coasters myself because, you know, I'm software and algorithms that don't j
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	I'm glad it was done but the adrenaline junkie in you might understand that now you know what it's all about
