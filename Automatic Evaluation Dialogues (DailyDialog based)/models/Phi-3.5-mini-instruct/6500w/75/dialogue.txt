Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	It's a pleasure meeting you again, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to recall previous interactions or remember
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's a delightful metaphor you have! However, I don't dance or recall the past—I'm here solely
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Apologies if the metaphor wasn't quite on the mark. I's not human, so dance and schwasty don't
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI developed by Microsoft. I don't have personal experiences or practice medicine. But I'm here to
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the Phi AI developed by Microsoft. It seems you have not provided the context that I am programmed to understand
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence language model created by Microsoft. You seem to be mixing realities. I don't have job experiences
