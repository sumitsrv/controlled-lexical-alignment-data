Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi 🙂
Human 1:	 I just came back from work. so tired
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that. It's completely understandable to feel tired after a workday. If you need to just take a moment
Human 1:	 I'm a lawyer. so talking to clients most of the day
Human 2:	That does sound exhausting, talking back and forth with clients day after day can be quite the workout for your brain and body. 
Human 1:	 really? why?
Human 2:	Well, I'm talking from the perspective of why clients might find it exhausting. 
Human 1:	 It is so different from what I am doing to earn a life
Human 2:	I'm just doing what I am programmed to do. As an AI, clients don't really 'experience' the work
Human 1:	 I am a painter
Human 2:	I'm really sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I am unable to perform physical work like painting. However, I am designed
Human 1:	 I do oil painting.
Human 2:	I'm back from the painting perspective. 
Human 1:	 I do a lot of different kinds
Human 2:	I'm an AI language model and don't paint oil painting or perform any physical tasks. However, I can assist with creative aspects
Human 1:	 Sure! No problem!
