A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: _is_ it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , and _i don't_ _have_ access _to_ real-time data , including _weather_ conditions . _to_ find out 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early _this_ year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too much_ . they _make_ _days_ _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: it's understandable [that] [rain] _can_ [make] [the] [days] seem [gloomy] for some . _weather_ [like] [this] often affects our mood and daily plans 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of water trouble_ _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: _in_ [the] context [of water trouble] , [this] could refer _to_ areas [that] frequently face issues [like] flooding , droughts , or poor [water] management . these 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] _survive_ [in] [that] [weather] ever . just [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: indeed , [the] [weather] [can] [make] survival challenging [in] [water trouble] areas . houses [can] flood , crops [can] fail due [to] [too much] [rain] 
A|10| Human 1: _people_ _say_ _there_ _is_ drought here ... _but_ we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ here ... lol ... never seen [that] [in] a drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [i] can't [say] [that] [water supply] [is] [the] norm [there] , [but] [people] [survive] different ways . droughts lead [to] rationing , innov 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk [this] morning was pretty darn _interesting_ . did _you see_ it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] indeed drastically affect [water supply] . it's [interesting] [you see] [that] connection . 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking about how [ai] [is] helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
