Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	I'm feeling just as trepidatious as you are, but ready for the challenge. Have done skydiving before? Absolutely
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm not a complete novice. Have you tried any extreme sports before skydiving? 
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I'm definitely getting that skiing feeling for you! Have fast speeds ever intimidated you before? 
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	That's great! I can imagine the feeling was similar to that first skydiving leap you took. 
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
