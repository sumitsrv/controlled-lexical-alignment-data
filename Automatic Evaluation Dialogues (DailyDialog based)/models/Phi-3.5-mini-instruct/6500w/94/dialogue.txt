Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't eat lunch or have physical experiences. I'm here 
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't eat, so I don't have the experience of choosing what and where you had lunch. However
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and I don't eat lunch either, though I can help you ponder some vegetarian options for your meal
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and I understand the context you're working with. Laughs aside, for humans considering vegetarian dishes, some
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and though I don't eat, vegetarian dishes are all the rage for humans. They've tried them
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and it's all food for humans but have you tried the kind that can taste like peanut butter yet prepared
