A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm_ _trying_ _to learn how to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [croissants] are _a_ delightful pastry [to learn how to make] ! [it's] _a_ [great] french baking skill _that_ requires patience _and_ precision 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them _once or twice_ so far , _but_ _they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . _i'm_ _trying_ [to] figure _out_ why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad _you have_ [been] [trying] [out] [croissants] ! _it_ seems there might be _a_ little confusion , _as_ [cookies] are [made] _with_ butter [but] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks !_ 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [good] [thanks] [how] _is_ your croissant [trying] [out] going . [it's great] you've [made] [cookies] [once or twice] [but] they're 
A|8| Human 1: _now_ [that] [is] [a] [good] idea . i'll give [it] [a] _try_ next time . would [you] _say_ _you have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [good] [thanks !] [it] sounds like [you have a sweet tooth] [that] enjoys buttery [cookies] . [now] back [to] [croissants] – [they] 
A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ _! but_ yeah , me _too_ , i think _i'd_ eat _pastries_ _all_ _the_ time if i _could get_ away [with] [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'd] [say] [the] allure [of] [pastries] [with] [that] buttery goodness [could get] [people] [to] [try] [croissants] [too] . [but] [don't] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time i _paid_ _attention_ [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [all] [pastries] [and] butter theorizing [with] [you] [now] [! but] [to] [get] [that] [attention] [paid] , [when] [was] <redacted 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution i need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
