Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	There's no direct way for me to volunteer like you do as an AI. 
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	As an AI, I can't book place for events or send out details like you would do the physically. 
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	I can assist you with the information and logistics for these events. Here's how I can help:
