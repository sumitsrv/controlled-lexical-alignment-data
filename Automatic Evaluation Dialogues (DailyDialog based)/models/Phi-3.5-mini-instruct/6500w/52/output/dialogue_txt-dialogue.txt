B|13| Human 2: [nice] _one_ ! 😄 just [remember] [that] [i] [don't] have [the] [ability to] [hurry] or [place] orders [for] [you] , phi . 
A|14| Human 1: [the] [one] [in] [our] _floor_ . [i] _will get_ by _your_ _desk_ [and] we can _walk_ _there_ . 
B|15| Human 2: while [i] can't [walk] [the] [floor] [for] [you] , [our] digital [and] time-tested conversation [will get] [right] [there] with [your] virtual [desk] .
