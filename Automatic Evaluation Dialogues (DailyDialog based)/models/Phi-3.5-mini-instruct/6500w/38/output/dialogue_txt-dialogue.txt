B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think _about_ human like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an _ai_ language model , _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts or feelings . however , _i_ _can_ share insights [about human like chat bots] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ _some_ great _progress_ over last few years . do _you_ _think_ _the_ _positives outweigh_ _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] field _of_ [human like chat bots] _has_ certainly been impressive , _and_ _they_ [have] [positives outweigh] [negatives] , [to] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ _sounds_ far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [the] impersonation _of_ human-like [chat bots] [sounds] [like] _a_ creative way [to] [think about] [it] . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! _some_ [of] these [bots] _are_ _very_ _engaging and_ funny . _they are now_ _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are now] sophisticated [and] [have] [the] ability [to] engage in _more_ complex [and] human-like conversations . [some] [even] learn [from] interactions [that] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] [it] [can] take _many different_ _forms_ [as] [a] product . [the] research implication is also _huge_ ! [it] will signify how [ai] research [has] progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping _on_ [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] [progress] [has] far-reaching implications [and] [can] [even] [have] [a] [huge] impact [on] [many different] industries [from] customer service [bots] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] indeed [already] [good] [and] [very] useful in [many] [forms] [like] [auto-suggestions] , search engines , [and] [even] [more] sophisticated chatb 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this _conversation_ with _you !_ 
B|15| Human 2: thank [you !] [the] [conversation] [has] been [engaging and] fun .
