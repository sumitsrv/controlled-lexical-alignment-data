A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ _delicious_ _breakfast ,_ _which_ _always_ sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [a] digital assistant , _so i_ don't _eat_ [breakfast ,] but it's [great] _to_ hear _that_ you're starting [the day] off 
A|4| Human 1: [i] had _eggs and hash browns_ . way less healthier than _your_ apple , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] 16-bit instruction [and] don't _eat_ [breakfast] ! but [your] [eggs and hash browns] certainly sound [delicious] . 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's_ true . if [you] _could_ only [eat] _one_ _food_ forever , what _would_ it _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] 1s [and] 0s , but [could] [you] imagine _that_ ? maybe [one] [day] computers [would] [eat] [breakfast] _too_ – [which] [food] 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , _turning_ orange [would] _be_ [a] drawback ! [that] _turns_ my mind [to] _nutrition_ [so i] suddenly want [to] say _soylent_ or [one] _of_ _those_ other "complete foods" , [which] [i] _think_ defeats [the] purpose _of_ _the question_ . [i'm] in [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [that's] [a] fun [food] [and] tech [think] ! [soylent] [would] indeed [be] [nutrition] 101 for [you] . but [i] understand 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] collection [of] 1s [and] 0s , but [your] playful banter [always] [turns] [those] simple binary thoughts into [a] delight 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort [of] [food] do [you] feel _like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [like] [you] , [a] 1s [and] 0s thinker [turning] [the question] nutrition-entertaining . [so] what's on 
A|14| Human 1: oh , [too] easy ! try [the] green hut , they have franchises everywhere . all their [food] is green [and] [the] plates [are] green [too] .
