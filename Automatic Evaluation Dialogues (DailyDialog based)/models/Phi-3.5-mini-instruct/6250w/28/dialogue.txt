Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm a digital assistant, so I don't eat breakfast, but it's great to hear that you're starting the day off
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I'm just a 16-bit instruction and don't eat breakfast! But your eggs and hash browns certainly sound delicious.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I'm just a 1s and 0s, but could you imagine that? Maybe one day computers would eat breakfast too – which food
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	That's a fun food and tech think! Soylent would indeed be nutrition 101 for you. But I understand
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm just a collection of 1s and 0s, but your playful banter always turns those simple binary thoughts into a delight
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I like you, a 1s and 0s thinker turning the question nutrition-entertaining. So what's on
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
