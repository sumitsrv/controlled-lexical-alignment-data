Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	Haha, you've got a point! I can't really cook Thanksgiving like a robot, but I'm here 2
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	Kale can lend you an earthy theme for Thanksgiving! Here is a fun and poetical take on the humble kale:
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	I talk like you more, human conversational poetically, not computers really! 
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	While computers have language like Python's simplicity or the complex syntax of C++, human conversation can be more about emotion and connection. 
Human 1:	 Yes!
Human 2:	Absolutely! 
Human 1:	 lol
