B|5| Human 2: _i_ don't [use] [softewares] [for] [video creation] because i'm phi _, _you_ are_ conversing with an ai powered by

B|11| Human 2: [what] [a] [cool] play-along [for] [this] digital conversation ! [music] [creation] [is] [a] fascinating field , whether [you use] [guitar] _in_ [the] physical world or 
A|12| Human 1: yes [, the] bar _chords _are_ the_ worst . it _took_ me _several months_ _to_ _play _them_ well_ . [i] _still_ [can't] _play them_ [for] [a] long time though 
B|13| Human 2: [just] [the] [chords are] challenging [for] [you] ! but [still] , your [guitar] play-along [took] [this] ai's algorithms [several months] - [well]
