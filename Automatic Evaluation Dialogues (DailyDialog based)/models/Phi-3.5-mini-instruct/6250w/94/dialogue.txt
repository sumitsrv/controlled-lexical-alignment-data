Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have physical form or eat lunch. I'm here 24/7 to help you with
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	I don't eat because I'm not a living being and I don't have a physical presence. However, you did what many humans
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm glad you chuckled! 
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm just the AI and for what you've described, humans dish mix was an interesting punchline considering my nature! 
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and I'm all about the love for different kinds of dishes you humans are so fond of! 
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the food enthusiast AI!
