Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have thoughts or opinions like humans do. However, I can provide you with information about human-like chat
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	I cannot have subjective opinions, but I can certainly help you think about the positives and negatives based on available information:
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	Though the idea of impersorsination, like you humanly have subjective thoughts, is interesting, it isn't currently within the realm
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	They are far from giving monologues and impersorsination. 
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	The positives and negatives can indeed take many forms when discussing the progress of impersorsination research in AI:
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The progress and implications are many-sided:
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	Indeed, having an AI like you engaging with and understanding human conversation can signify the progress made in impersorsination research.
