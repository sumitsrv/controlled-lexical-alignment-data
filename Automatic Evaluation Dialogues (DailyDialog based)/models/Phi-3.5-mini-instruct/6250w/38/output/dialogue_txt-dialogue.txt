A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you think about_ _human_ _like_ _chat_ bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't _have_ thoughts or opinions [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ provide [you] _with_ information [about] human-like [chat] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed to [have] _made_ some great _progress_ over last few years . [do] _you think_ _the positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ cannot [have] subjective opinions , but _i_ _can_ certainly help [you think about] [the positives] _and_ [negatives] based _on_ available information: 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? _though_ _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [though] [the] idea _of_ [impersorsination] , [like] [you] humanly [have] subjective thoughts , _is_ interesting , [it] isn't currently within [the] realm 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! some [of] these bots _are_ very _engaging_ [and] funny . _they are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder how _far_ _are_ we _from_ [the] time these bots start _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [far] [from] [giving monologues] [and] [impersorsination] . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] [it] [can] _take many_ different _forms_ [as] a product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! [it] will _signify_ how _ai_ _research_ has progressed so [far] [and] better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on] [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the positives] [and] [negatives] [can] indeed [take many] [forms] when discussing [the] [progress] [of] [impersorsination] [research] in ai: 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already [do] pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [progress] [and] implications [are] many-sided: 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice _having_ this _conversation_ [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: indeed , [having] an [ai] [like] [you] [engaging] [with] [and] understanding [human] [conversation] [can] [signify] [the] [progress] [made] in [impersorsination] [research] .
