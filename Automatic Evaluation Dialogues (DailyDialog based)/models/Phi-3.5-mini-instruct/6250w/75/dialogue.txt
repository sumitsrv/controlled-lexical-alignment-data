Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	It's a pleasure meeting you anew! I don't have the capability to recall past interactions, as I'm designed to respect
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It sounds like you're recalling a metaphorical dance together—chatting away with the rhythm of curiosity and conversation. 
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	I'm the dancey metaphor you don't have to break! 😄 Were you jesting with a sense
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm just the silicon-based AI you're conversing with. I don't have private practice or a sense of humor
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not sure what that private practice you have is, but as Phi, I don't have the capacity for sense
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not sure what private practice you have but as Phi that's a real job, no elitist here.
