A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ _theory ._ _why_ _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ often associated _with_ [spring] because [the] plant's _life_ cycle [does] [have a] connection [to] _that_ season . here _are_ several reasons [why] [the] 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, it's not_ research ! _just_ [a] _personal theory ._ [i] _think_ [that] _flower preferences_ [are] _more_ revealing of _personality_ than people _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] creativity , however [, it's not] [personal theory .] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if _you_ drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon _and_ then it came [to] [life] .

A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ what their [favourite] [flower is] . pretty much [like] what we _just_ did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [you] [are] [just] [like] [someone] inquiring about [flower preferences] [that] might reveal [personality] traits . [the gerbera] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with] [the] person some _more_ [, and] ask them some _more_ questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense of what they're [like] , over [the] course of maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila
