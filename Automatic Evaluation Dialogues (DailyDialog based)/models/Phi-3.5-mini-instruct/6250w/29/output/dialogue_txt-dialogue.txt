B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _a_ microsoft language model _, so i_ don't _take_ part-time [class] or shifts as [you] and other humans do 
A|6| Human 1: oh _that_ _is_ awesome ! _for_ some reason [i] assumed it was [a] college [class] [, but] [a] sewing [class] _sounds_ way better _! i_ _work_ full _time_ [, _but] i_ [take] _pottery_ classes _from_ _time_ _to_ _time_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [from] microsoft and [part] _of your_ [great] conversation 😄 [but] [pottery] [sounds] [cool !] though my [work] [time] [is]

B|11| Human 2: [it's] [all the] [tea] [you] [love] _that [i_ would] [like] [to] explore . [for] example , if [one] ounce [of] black [tea] contains _about_ 4 cal 
A|12| Human 1: ahh , those [are] mostly [from] japan , no ? [i] [like] white _teas_ , [like] silver needle . 
B|13| Human 2: [it's] [all] [tea] [from] [the] [teas] [you] [like] [that] [would] be [great] [to] explore [balance] in [your] [drink] selections 🙂 [for] [your] 
A|14| Human 1: [i] actually found [a] youtube _channel_ called <redacted_term> [that i] [like] [a] lot . [you] should check it out _! the_ host talks [about] [all] kinds [of] [different] [teas] . 
B|15| Human 2: [that] [sounds] [like] an interesting [channel] [! the] host's expertise [would] [make] [the] [balance] [of] [teas] [you] [love] [all] [about] [tea] drinking [that] much more
