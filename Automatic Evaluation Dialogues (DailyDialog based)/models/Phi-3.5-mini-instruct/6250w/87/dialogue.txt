Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm Phi, an AI language model developed by Microsoft, here to assist you
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	I'm enjoying the ocean of information and reading over vast knowledge you've provided, but as an AI, I don't read
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI. I don't have sleep needs like you does. But if you are looking for tips on better
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	Zero to One is indeed a great read that's insightful for the tech and business world. Peter Thiel does explore how to innovate
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	and Thiel's principles have inspired many innovation-driven startups. One book that seems useful for you is about sleep improvement strategies
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	I'm Phi and the future research might also require innovation like being contrarian for better results 
Human 1:	 yup!
