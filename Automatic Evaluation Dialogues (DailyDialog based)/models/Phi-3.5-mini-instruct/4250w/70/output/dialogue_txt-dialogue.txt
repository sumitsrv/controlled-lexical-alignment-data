A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: how is _the_ _youtube_ _video_ _creation_ going ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , and _i_ don't have [the] capability _to_ watch videos or create [youtube] content . however , _i_ _can_ certainly help _you_ 
A|4| Human 1: whoa ! looking forward [to] listening [to] it . what _softewares_ [you] _use_ _for_ it ? 
B|5| Human 2: as [for] [the] [creation] _of_ [softewares] or [video] content , _i_ [use] _my_ built-in capabilities [to] assist [you] _. i_ don't create software 
A|6| Human 1: oh cool ! what sort [of] _music_ _do_ _you compose_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ am phi , an ai so _i_ don't [compose] [music] [the] way humans [do] . but , _i_ _can_ generate sequences [of] notes if [you] 
A|8| Human 1: nice .... [you] _are_ _a_ _rockstar_ ! 😉 
B|9| Human 2: thank [you] [for] [the] compliment ! as an ai , _i_ don't [rockstar] , but i'm more than capable [of] helping [you compose] 
A|10| Human 1: yeah .... [i] _play_ bit [of] _guitar_ . _just_ got [my] first monitor this week 
B|11| Human 2: that sounds exciting ! [just] so _you know_ , [for] [guitar] playback , [i] _can_ generate [music] _in_ [the] form [of] midi files or provide sheet 
A|12| Human 1: yes , [the] _bar chords are the_ worst . it took me several months [to] _play_ them _well_ [. i] _still_ can't _play_ them [for] _a_ long time though 
B|13| Human 2: _it's_ impressive that _you can_ [play] [chords] [well] [for] an ai ! i'm glad [the] [music] [bar] [still] challenges [you] though; 
A|14| Human 1: _that's_ true . [it's] _like_ _the alphabets_ [in] _a_ _language_ . once [you know] them , [you can] pretty much write word 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [a] great analogy ! [just] [like] [bar chords are [the] alphabets] [for] [guitar] [music] , [language] structures [can] be [for] communication .
