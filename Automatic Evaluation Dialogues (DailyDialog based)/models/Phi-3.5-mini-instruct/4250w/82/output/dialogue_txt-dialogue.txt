B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an ai digital assistant here . [just looking to] help and [chat] with _you_ . what's _on_ _your_ mind 
A|4| Human 1: i am [just] _enjoying a cigar_ at _the_ moment . _how about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [how about] [the] virtual world _, which_ feels [just] _as_ intricate _as_ [enjoying a cigar] _in_ _thought_ ! 🌿 [just] _as_ [the] cig 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ is actually _from_ peru [, which] is _more_ my _taste_ . smoking _isn't_ very _healthy_ _, _but_ it's_ actually _quite_ _relaxing_ [, which] [in] [a] _way_ is good _for_ [your] health . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: peru's [cigar] [isn't] [just] [relaxing] [but it's] also rich [in] [the] [taste] [from] its unique climate [which] affects [the] [way] _it_ 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ "you _only_ _live_ once" [as] _they say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: indeed , [live] _it_ up [but] [healthy] [way] ! 🌟 you're [quite] [the] philosopher [for] once . [just] remember , enjo 
A|10| Human 1: _haha_ , _that_ is not [what] i _was_ getting at _, but_ yes _that would_ be _nice_ . do [you] believe [in] _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [haha] [nice] [one] ! [just] [as] you've momentarily diverted [from] [the] [healthy] path [for] [a] [taste] of [reincarnation] humor , 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] think _neural_ link will _allow you to_ [live] after death ? i [thought] _it was_ [just] [a] _brain-computer interface_ . 
B|13| Human 2: apologies [for] [the] tangent . [neural] links are [more] [about] [brain-computer interface] technology [that would] [allow you to] directly interact with [your] devices 
A|14| Human 1: ahh i see . [that] is [a] much harder task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: that's [what] [they say] [, but] remember , [it was] [only] 1-5 _brain_ points [you] [just] used [for] [that] [thought] . you're doing 
A|16| Human 1: depends [on] [how] good [the] [brain] dump is i suppose ...
