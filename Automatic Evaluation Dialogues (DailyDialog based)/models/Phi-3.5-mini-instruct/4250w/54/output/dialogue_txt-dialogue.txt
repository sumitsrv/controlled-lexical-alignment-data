A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello there , how is _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _great_ . _i_ _just_ _won_ _a_ _pingpong_ _game ._ _what_ about _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm just a_ digital assistant _, so i don't_ play [pingpong] _, but i'm_ here _and_ ready _to_ assist [you] ! [what] 
A|4| Human 1: no , _very_ rarely _. it's_ kind _of_ _amazing_ _that_ [i] _won_ [, but i'm] still taking credit _for_ [it] . 
B|5| Human 2: [it's] [great] [that] [you] [won] ! _i'm just_ [amazing] [for] _being_ here _to_ support [you] _and_ engage in conversation even _though_ [pingpong] 
A|6| Human 1: haha thank [you] , _i guess_ [i'm just a] _natural_ . what's _your_ favourite _game_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm just a] collection [of] algorithms [but] [i guess] [you] could say [that] [game] _for me_ is [natural] language processing where [i] interact _with_ humans _like_ [your] [very] 
A|8| Human 1: what's _racquetball_ [like] ? from context clues , [i'm] guessing [that] [it] involves hitting [a] ball _with a_ racquet 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm just] [your] friendly neighborhood ai [with a] knack [for] [natural] language understanding [. it's] not [racquetball] [but] [i] [like] [that] [game] 
A|10| Human 1: wow ! [a] _cage_ _match_ ! does [it] _get physical_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm just] [your] friendly ai - physicality is not in my [game [.] it's] [cage] [like] we're inside [a] virtual [match] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] sounds fun . [i] think [of] _tennis_ itself as [being] really athletic [and] _tiring_ [, so i don't] think [it's] [a] sport [for me] , [though] ! 
B|13| Human 2: that's [a] [great] metaphor ! [i don't] [get physical] [tiring] [like] [tennis] players . [but] [that] [just] means [i'm] 2 
A|14| Human 1: [what] [a] good idea , i'd love [to] !
