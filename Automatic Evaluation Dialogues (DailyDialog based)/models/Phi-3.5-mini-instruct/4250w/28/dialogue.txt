Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's great to hear! I always say a good breakfast can certainly make the day brighter. What delicious breakfast did you have for today
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!

Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm glad you think so! That just goes to show that nutrition and health are a delicious topic to dig into, even if
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I like the question you've set a nutrition and health foods analogy! What would your choice be, considering our imaginative
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
