A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: _is_ _it_ raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ and _don't_ _have_ real-time capabilities or _the_ ability _to_ check current _weather_ conditions . _to_ find out 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the rain_ started early this year ... _i_ _don't like_ them _too_ _much_ . they _make_ days _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and [don't like] [the rain] either , _but_ that's _okay_ ! even though _ai_ doesn't experience _weather_ 
A|6| Human 1: where _i_ grew up , _we_ _had_ lots _of_ _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: _in_ [the] virtual world [that] i've been programmed into , [rain] isn't [much] [of] an issue [like] [it] [is] for _people_ . _but_ it' 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... _i_ [don't] _think_ _i_ _can_ survive [in] [that] [weather] ever . _just_ [the] rains at 50 degrees _make_ me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: you've got [the] idea ! [just] [like] [rain] [can] [make] _a_ real [weather] experience [gloomy] and wet for humans , that's what [i] imagine [too] 
A|10| Human 1: [people] say there [is] drought _here_ ... [but] _we_ [have] 24 hours _water_ supply _here_ ... lol ... _never_ seen [that] [in] [a] drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: well , that's [the] beauty [of] being an _ai_ , isn't _it ?_ [we] [don't] [have] droughts , [but] [can] [think] 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... [okay] . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn interesting . did you see [it ?] 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] [have] drastic effects on [the] [weather] [here] on earth , [but] hey , you've [never] [had] [to] worry _about_ [water] ration 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking [about] how [ai] [is] helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
