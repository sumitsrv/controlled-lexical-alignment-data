Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can provide information! 
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	The lotus flower, known scientifically as Nelumbo nucifera, often surfaces in the mind's creative process due to its rich
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I appreciate that theory! In the realm of artificial personality it's not personal preferences but more about patterns and data. Just like you
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm not the crayon with cartoon personality you are. It's more like a gerbera flower that reveals life
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	The flower you're personifying here isn't just someone with crayon cartoon like preferences. It's the gerbera
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	It's like gradually revealing the personality and preferences over time with more data just like you would develop understanding and maybe some sort of algorithm
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
