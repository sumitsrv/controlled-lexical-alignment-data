A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can provide information ! 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ _theory_ . why does _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] , known scientifically _as_ nelumbo nucifera , often surfaces in [the] mind's creative process due [to] its rich 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! _just_ _a_ [personal] _theory_ . [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ _revealing_ _of_ _personality_ than people _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [that] [theory] ! in [the] realm [of] artificial [personality] [it's not] [personal] [preferences] but [more] about patterns _and_ data . [just] _like_ [you] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. _it's_ _like_ a_ _cartoon_ [flower] . [as] if [you] drew "flower" _with_ _a_ _crayon_ [and] then it came [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [the] [crayon] [with] [cartoon] [personality] [you] [are] [. it's] [more] [like a] [gerbera] [flower] [that] reveals [life] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask _someone_ what their favourite [flower] is . pretty much [like] what we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [flower] you're personifying here isn't [just] [someone] [with] [crayon] [cartoon] [like] [preferences] [. it's] [the gerbera] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some_ [more] , [and] ask them _some_ [more] questions , [and] _gradually_ _develop_ [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] _maybe_ two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's like] [gradually] [revealing] [the] [personality] [and] [preferences] [over] time [with] [more] data [just] [like] [you] would [develop] understanding [and] [maybe] [some] sort [of] algorithm 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
