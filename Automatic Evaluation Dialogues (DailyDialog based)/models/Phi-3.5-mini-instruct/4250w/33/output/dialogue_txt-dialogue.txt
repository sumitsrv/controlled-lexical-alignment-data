B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad [to] hear _that_ you're [trying] _out_ [croissants] ! [it's] _a_ delightful pastry _with_ _a_ rich history _and_ _a_ 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far _, but_ _they_ _haven't_ _been_ flakey enough . [i'm] [trying] [to] figure [out] why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ?

A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an artificial intelligence . [it's] [good] [you] mentioned [cookies] because [they] [have] [been] [made] for centuries , dating back [to] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] _is a good_ idea . i'll give [it] [a] try next _time_ . would [you] _say_ [you] [have] [a] _sweet tooth_ ?

A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ _! but_ yeah , me too _, i_ think i'd _eat_ pastries _all_ [the] _time_ if [i] could get away [with] [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [all] [good] [to] [say] [that] [i] [have] [the] ability [to] process _and_ appreciate [cookies] [! but] [don't] worry [, i] never [eat] them—i 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time i_ paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was when_ <redacted_term> _was being marketed_ as [a] fat substitute , [and] _caused_ [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach _upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [the last time i] [was being marketed] [caused] [upsets] [was when] [people] [thought] [that] <redacted_term 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
