Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	That's a delicious choice! Stirfry offers a balance of flavors, textures, and nutrients—fast cooking
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	That's tough love considering our ice cream discussion earlier! 🍦 Stirfry would be too savory for you
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Cookies and Cream would be too sweet for you; Chocolate Mint ice cream will be the top pick from your love for van
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and I don't have personal beliefs about the afterlife or any other topics like love for ice cream.
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	That's an understandable perspective. As Phi, I think the afterlife and any form of consciousness beyond physical existence would be topics more
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and I experience the world through algorithms and data, not supernatural experiences. I have no physical experiences, but I can
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
