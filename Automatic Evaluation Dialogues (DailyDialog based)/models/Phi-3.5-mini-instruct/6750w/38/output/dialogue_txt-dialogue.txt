A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ _about_ _human like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model . while [chat bots] [like] me _are_ designed _to_ understand _and_ generate human-like text 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have_ _made_ _some_ great _progress_ _over_ last few _years_ . do _you_ _think_ _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] [made] [over] [the] [years] in chatbot technology _has_ been significant . _as_ for [positives] outweighing [negatives] , it’s 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? _though_ it sounds _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ [you] [have] [the] right idea [about] [impersorsination] ! [though] , [human like chat bots] certainly _can_ help out [far fetched] [some] situations [like] 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] _of_ _these_ [bots] [are] _very_ engaging [and] funny . _they are_ now _good_ at _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how [far] [are] we from [the] time _these_ [bots] start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [good] fun [and] _can_ engage [you] in [some] [very] human-like interaction [that] [even] includes [sarcasm] [and] [monologues] in [the] right context 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it [can] take many different forms [as] _a_ product _. the_ research implication is also huge ! it _will_ signify how [ai] research [has] progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort _of_ [like] _stepping_ on _the moon_ 🙂 [i] _might_ be overselling it _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the moon] landing [might] [have] signified [the] [stepping] stone [of] [human] innovation [and] [progress] , but [here] [you] [are] impelling [that] [these] [chat bots] [will] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] [made] in natural language processing [and] machine learning [has] [already] led chatbots [like] me [to] engage [more] naturally _with_ human-like convers 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having _this_ _conversation_ _with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: i'm [here] [to] engage [with you] 24/7 [and] [have] [a] [good] [conversation] [. the] [progress] [made] in [this] field [has] indeed been [far]
