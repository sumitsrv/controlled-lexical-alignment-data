Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	It's possible you have met me in the sense of interacting with me through this platform where our conversation is taking place. I don't
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's delightful you have a sense of playful interaction! However, as an AI language model, I don't dance or recall
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	It's great you have such a sense of humor! I assure you, I don't dance, smile, or recall per se but
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, Microsoft's Phi assistant. I don't have a private practice, but I'm here 24
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, Microsoft's Phi assistant, designed to provide you 24/7 assistance. You have not met a card
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not elitist but I focus on providing accurate information. I have no job per se, I'm Microsofts
