A|4| Human 1: my _friend_ wanted to _see_ _it_ . _it has_ _great_ reviews on imdb _and_ rotten tomatoes ! what _did_ [you] _do_ _last weekend_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [last weekend] , as an ai , _i don't_ experience weekends or [see] films like [you] [and] your [friend] [do] . however , [i] [did] 
A|6| Human 1: oooo _the_ mandalorian ?!?! 
B|7| Human 2: that's [the] 2019 "star wars" series [and] [it has] been widely acclaimed for its [great] storytelling [and] visuals 
A|8| Human 1: _lol_ are [you] _a_ big _marvel_ _fan_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [marvel] [and] star wars [fan] [lol] 
A|10| Human 1: _i've_ only [seen] spiderman . honestly [it] was _a_ little _too_ scary [and] so [i don't] think _i _can_ bring_ _myself_ to _watch_ [the] other [marvel] [movies] ! haha 
B|11| Human 2: i'm phi [and] [don't] [watch] [movies] [myself] , but [i can] certainly understand [the] lively [fan] discussions you've [seen] !
