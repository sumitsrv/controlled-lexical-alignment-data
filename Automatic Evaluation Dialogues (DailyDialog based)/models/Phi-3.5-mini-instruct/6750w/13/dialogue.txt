Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm familiar with "The Parasite" (also known as 기생충) from 20
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	Last weekend, as an AI, I don't experience weekends or see films like you and your friend do. However, I did
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	That's the 2019 "Star Wars" series and it has been widely acclaimed for its great storytelling and visuals
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	Marvel and Star Wars fan lol 
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I'm Phi and don't watch movies myself, but I can certainly understand the lively fan discussions you've seen!
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I've seen and heard the good side too! 
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki is actually a character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and not a real actor's name. I see how that can bring some confusion
