B|9| Human 2: [i'm trying to] [have] [that] [sweet] [but] thoughtful [flakey] [idea] [you] mentioned . [it] seems like [good] baking , like [croissants] [or] [cookies] 
A|10| Human 1: some people don't ! _but yeah ,_ me [too ,] i think i'd eat _pastries_ [all] [the] _time_ if i could get away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'll] [make] [you] [the] sweetest [pastries] [with] [that] [flakey] idea—dissolve butter [to] [give] [them] [that] alluring lightness 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time_ i paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [all] ears [when] [you have] [that] [sweet] [and] [flakey] [idea .] [but yeah ,] [the last time] [was] [with] <redacted_ter 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution i need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
