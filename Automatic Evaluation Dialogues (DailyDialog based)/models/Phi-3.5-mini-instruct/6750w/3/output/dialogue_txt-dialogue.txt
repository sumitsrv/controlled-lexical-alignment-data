A|2| Human 1: is it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , and _i don't_ _have_ access _to_ real-time data or _the_ ability _to_ check current _weather_ conditions . _to_ find out 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ [the] _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ _them_ _too much_ . they _make_ _days_ _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ language model . [i] understand [that] [rain] _can_ [make] [the] [days] feel [gloomy] for some _people_ . while [i] don 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots of _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [water] challenges [like] [rain] , floods , or _drought_ _can_ _have_ significant impacts on [the] communities [that] experience [them] . they're often 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive in [that] [weather] ever . just _the rains_ at 50 degrees [make] _me_ _want_ [to] sit in _heated_ rroms 
B|9| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , programmed without [weather] knowledge , _but_ [can] certainly understand [that] [rains] [make] many [want] comforts [like] he 
A|10| Human 1: [people] say there is [drought] _here_ ... [but] we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ _here_ ... lol ... never seen [that] in a [drought] ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: i'm [here] [to] lend an ear , [but] [don't] worry [too much] _about_ [water supply] riddles—even _ai_ [like] [me] [can] 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn interesting . did you see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] [have] drastic effects ranging from [water supply] issues [like] you've mentioned , [to] [the rains] [that] [make] [people] [want] [heated] 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking [about] how [ai] is helping [climate change] . nice use of upcoming tech .
