Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	Ha! I guess you caught me for once. My responses are designed to be neutral and informative. I don't really have plans like humans
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	I can't pick the theme for you or have poetical inclinations, but if you're looking to craft a Thanksgiving-
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	As an AI language model, I don't have preferences, talk human like you, more computers I can process and communicate information for you
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not really about favorite languages. My design is for language processing and not for personal preferences or human-like emotions
Human 1:	 Yes!
Human 2:	Understood! As Phi, I'm here for language understanding and information processing. If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free
Human 1:	 lol
