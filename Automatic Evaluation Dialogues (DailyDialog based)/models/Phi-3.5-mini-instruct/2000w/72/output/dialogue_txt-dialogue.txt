A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't _reflect_ _back_ too much _on_ things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have_ been _very_ favorable _for_ me in terms _of_ _time_ _spent_ _with_ family _and_ friends _and_ _work_ _life balance_ . why do [you] _ask_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [ask] [you] _to_ [reflect] [and] share your experiences [for] _a_ couple [of] reasons: 
A|4| Human 1: great ! good _idea_ [to] help people figuring out their new [year] resolutions 🙂 so _how_ do [i] get [a] fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: 1 . **self-reflection:** look [back] [on] _the_ [year] [with] an open [and] nonjudgmental attitude . consider [how] [you] [spent] [time] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ ! [i] _think_ [the] _idea_ does _have_ some potential . [how] did [you] _come_ up [with] _this idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: thanks _for the_ positive feedback [and] [for] suggesting [this idea] ! 
A|8| Human 1: thats great ! [this] _is_ valuable help [for the] community . [i] _think_ _mental health_ _is_ one [of] [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: absolutely , [mental health] [and] self-reflection are crucial [for] personal growth [and] well-being . here's [how] [you] could [think] 
A|10| Human 1: _that is_ actually [a] _quote_ stolen _from_ my tl when [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs [of] _work_ _experience_ , [i] fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: your [quote] reflects [the] wisdom you've gained [from] [experience] . [that is] an important realization . 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] [think] family [and] friends play [a] big role here . 2 . meaningful _work_ life; [this] may mean _exploring_ around [with] new stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... so [on] 🙂 [what] about [you] ? [is] there [a] _right answer_ [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: there's no [right answer] [for] [this] as self-reflection [and] [life balance] are [very] personal . [what] you've outlined are excellent starting points 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's_ [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also _music_ earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [music] [and] spirituality indeed [have] [the] power [to] elevate our [mental health] [and] enhance self-reflection . 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually not much [of] [a] reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting _john_ nash ~ _reading_ books corrupts _original thoughts_ 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] an interesting perspective . however , [original thoughts] [and] ideas often [come] [from] [reading] [and] [exploring] [the] experiences [of] others . [john] nash's [work] 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! it may turn out [to] be [a] best seller :)
