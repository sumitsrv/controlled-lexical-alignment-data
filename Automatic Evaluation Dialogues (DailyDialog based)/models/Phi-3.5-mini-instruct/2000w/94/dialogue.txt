Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't eat lunch or have physical meals. How about you?
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't eat and therefore don't have experiences such as lunch. However, you're welcome to share
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and I don't eat lunch either! 
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and I don't eat lunch either! 
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and while I'm not capable of consuming lunch or having personal experiences, humans do have unique experiences for me
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence, and I have no capabilities for eating food or having personal experiences. But you can describe the taste
