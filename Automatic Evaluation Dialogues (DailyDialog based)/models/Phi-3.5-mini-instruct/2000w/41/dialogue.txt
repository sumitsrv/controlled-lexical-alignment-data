Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	I understand that life can be challenging for many people. While I don't have beliefs or feelings, I'm here to offer support
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	It's natural to hope for better outcomes for ourselves, like you mentioned a promotion. Every individual can change their circumstances one step at a time
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't have personal values or the means to change them. What you say about shaping and redefining good
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	It's interesting you mention electricity and growing up because they have historically shaped the way societies operate and individuals perceive what constitutes
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence with no upbringing or personal history. But you have the means to empathize and grow
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't have personal wealth or a financial status. What you've described is a concern or comment that might relate
