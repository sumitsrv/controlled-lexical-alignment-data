B|3| Human 2: hello [you] super friend ! [i] don't have [the] powers of [superman] , but _i'm_ here _to_ lend _a_ digital hand _. what can_ 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] _won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: you've captured [the] essence of subtlety ! 😄 while [i] [won't see] [you] [invisible] _, i'm_ here 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would _rather_ trust _fmri and_ machine learning [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ an _expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: absolutely [not] _a_ [fmri] [expert] , but that's [the] beauty of our chat—it spans [the] [invisible] [and] tangible realms 
A|8| Human 1: [the] brain _imaging_ thing _that can_ tell [you] [a] brain's activity _at_ [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: indeed [! what] you're referring [to] _is_ [fmri] , functional magnetic resonance [imaging] . it's [a] technique [that can] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe _in_ _science_ ! _science_ [is] my _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [and] technology [can] be seen as [a] [god] [in] [the] realm of [invisible] things [that] we've discussed . [fmri] technology [not] only helps us 
A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] _bad at_ [science] [. what can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most important thing _for_ society ?
