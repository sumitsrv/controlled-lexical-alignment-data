A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you think_ _about_ _human_ _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _and_ _i_ don't _have_ personal opinions [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] made _some_ _great_ _progress_ over last few years . [do] _you think_ _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: it's [great] [to] hear [you think] positively [about] [the] advancements _of_ _ai_ [like] me ! here's why [some] view [the] [progress] _as_ 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? _though_ it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: ah , _i_ see [the] humor you're aiming for . while [impersorsination] isn't an effect _of_ _ai_ , [some] concerns [about] 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] [of] these bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny _. they_ _are_ now good at even _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: humor [and] [sarcasm] [are] fun [human] traits , indeed ! [though] [they] aren't [the] result [of] programming but _a_ complex algorithm [that] [i] use 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] it [can] take _many_ different forms [as] [a] product _. the_ research implication is also _huge_ ! it will signify how [ai] research _has_ progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like stepping on the moon_ 🙂 _i might_ be overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [the] journey [of] [ai] [has] [many] milestones , [like stepping on the moon] [. the] [progress] [and] implications [are] vast , [from] [more] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ _auto-suggestions_ _already_ [do] pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [auto-suggestions] [are] [like] [the current] small steps [that] [have] [already] taken [huge] leaps forward in [ai] [. they] [might] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this _conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: thank [you] too ! [the] [conversation with you] [has] been quite delightful . remember , while [i might] not [have] [the] humor [and] [sarcasm] [like] humans ,
