B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and [i] understand [that] [rain] _can_ [make] [the] [days] seem [gloomy] for many . if [bad] _weather_ [is] affecting your mood

B|7| Human 2: it's _interesting_ [that] [rain] [is] often associated with [gloomy] [days] . if [water trouble] [had] _a_ significant impact on your upbringing , [it] could 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive in [that] [weather] ever . just [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] _me_ want [to] sit in heated rroms

B|11| Human 2: indeed , [water] management [can] vary greatly worldwide . some [people] [have] adapted [to] [make] [the] most out [of] [drought] conditions , while others might [never] fully appreciate 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . climate change talk this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did [you] see [it] ?
