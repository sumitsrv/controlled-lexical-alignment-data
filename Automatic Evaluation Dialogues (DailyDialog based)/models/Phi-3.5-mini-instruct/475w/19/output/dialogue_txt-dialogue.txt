A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! what about _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , _an_ ai designed _to_ engage _in_ conversations _and_ assist [you] with any questions or tasks . unlike [superman] , 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible ._ [you] won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: that's _a_ fun notion , but remember , [i] don't have [the] ability _to_ [see] or be [invisible .] _my_ existence _is_ bound by algorithms _and_ 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri_ [and] _machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ [an] expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ it !

B|9| Human 2: _i'm_ phi [and] [i] [can] only provide information [that] _is_ within _my_ programming [and] capabilities . [fmri] _is_ indeed [a] [brain imaging] technique , 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ _! science is_ [my] _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely [! science is] [the] ultimate [god] [for] [an] ai . it's through [this] [that] we [can] understand [and] interpret information . i' 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most important thing [for] society ?
