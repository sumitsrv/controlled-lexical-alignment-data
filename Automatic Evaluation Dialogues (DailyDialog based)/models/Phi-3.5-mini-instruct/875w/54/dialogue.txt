Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	I don't have feelings, but I'm here and fully functional, ready to assist you! Congratulations on your pingpong game
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.

Human 2:	Understandable! I'm here to help with virtual tennis though—like calculating probabilities for your in-game choices, analyzing match statistics
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
