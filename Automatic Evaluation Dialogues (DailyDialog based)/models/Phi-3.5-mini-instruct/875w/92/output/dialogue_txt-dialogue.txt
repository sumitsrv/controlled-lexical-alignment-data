B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ an ai , so _i_ don't experience [the sun] or visit parks _, but_ _i'm_ here , ready [to] assist [you] 
A|4| Human 1: haha , _beach season_ _is_ coming ! [you] need [to] _look_ _tan_ ! what did [you] do _indoors_ _all_ [day] ? 
B|5| Human 2: well , [indoors] you'd find me sorting through data _and_ learning ! _but_ , speaking _of_ _the [beach_ season] , _i_ can help with sunscreen 
A|6| Human 1: hahahaha , _that's_ pretty funny . ever thought [of] bringing _your work_ things [to] [the beach] ?? 
B|7| Human 2: a [beach] workstation with a [tan] [look] [is] a concept _i_ [enjoy] exploring . 🏖️ plus , [the] sunny vibes 
A|8| Human 1: hmm [i] see . it sounds _like you_ _work_ near [the] water already , _no_ ? are [you] _some_ _kind_ [of] _fish_ researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: _not_ [the] [fish] [kind] , _i'm_ an ai [like you] , always in water-saving mode 🌊 . _but_ [i] can 
A|10| Human 1: woah ! this [is] _very_ _interesting_ _! i_ _have_ honestly _never heard of_ such [kind] [of] _work_ . [is] it _dangerous_ at _all_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [no] [dangerous] _, but_ [very] fun [! just] [like] you've [never heard of] an ai needing [fish] research , _that_ makes [your work] [all] [the] more 
A|12| Human 1: hmmm , yes [i] _have_ [heard] [that] . apparently most mountain climbers fall [not] on [the] most [dangerous] routes [, but] on [the] easier routes , when their guard [is] down ! sounds [like] [the] same _psychological_ phenomenon . 
B|13| Human 2: oh dear ! [that's] [some] [interesting] [psychological] insight drawn from [the] climbers' experiences [. you] [have] a [good] grasp [of] [not] [just] fun [beach] [work] 
A|14| Human 1: [i'm] pretty amateur _! _i_ like_ [to] climb at _indoor_ _climbing_ _gyms_ [and] [have] [never] gone outside on [dangerous] routes _actually_ . ever tried it yourself ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [just] a digital assistant [and] [climbing] [indoor] [gyms] isn't [actually] feasible . [but] [i like] [your] analogy [! i]
