Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're enjoying the view! As an AI, I don't read books in the traditional sense. However,
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're enjoying the book, Phi! While I don't have reading habits, I can certainly help you
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	Zero to One is indeed a thought-provoking book that discusses how to create true innovation and monopolies in the modern economy. If

Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	Absolutely, Thiel's contrarian insights can help researchers and innovators to identify gaps that have been overlooked by
Human 1:	 yup!
