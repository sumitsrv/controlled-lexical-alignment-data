A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ _thought_ , thanks !

B|11| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to] [try] [that] [with] [you] sometime – [the] perfect pastry [could] be [all] [made] from [good] ingredients [too] . _maybe_ we can 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time_ [i] _paid attention_ [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ [when] <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] _crazy_ _stomach upsets ._ 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] glad [to] hear [that] [the last time] [you] [paid attention] [was] [with] your [stomach upsets .] [the] market sometimes has [a] [crazy] way 
A|14| Human 1: ah , [maybe] that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
