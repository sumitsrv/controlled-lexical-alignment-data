A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , _how are you_ 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ am _good_ . [how are you] ? ：） 
B|3| Human 2: i'm [good] , thanks _for_ asking ! i'm phi , an ai language model . [i] don't have feelings , but [i] 
A|4| Human 1: [i] am busy . _a_ lot _of_ _work_ _. what_ _are you working on_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , phi [are you] 🤖 . [i] don't [work] [on] tasks in the traditional sense , but [i] 
A|6| Human 1: [i] am _working on_ _a_ new _classifier_ . 
B|7| Human 2: interesting ! as phi , _you are_ equipped with [a] vast database _for_ text generation and processing [. what] type [of] [classifier] [are you working on] 
A|8| Human 1: [a] new [classifier] [for] _hate speech_ . which _research topic_ catches your eyes _most_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: the [most] interesting [research topic] [for] [classifier] development currently might be related _to_ ethical ai and responsible machine learning . 
A|10| Human 1: nice ! do [you] refer [to] [work] or anything else ? 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [work] related [to] [classifier] development [for] identifying [hate speech] is [a] pressing [topic] in the field [of] ethical ai and responsible machine learning: 
A|12| Human 1: [you are] very cool too !!
