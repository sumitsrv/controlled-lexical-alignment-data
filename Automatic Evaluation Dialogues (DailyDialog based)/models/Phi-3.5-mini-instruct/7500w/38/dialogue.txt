Human 2:	Though sarcasm and monologues are human traits that even the most advanced AI may have difficulty fully understanding and mimicking.
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	The progress is definitely overselling the current capabilities and research implication might indeed take more time and sophisticated technological breakthroughs.
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	True, auto-suggestions and already sophisticated forms of engaging bots are here now. They can have human-like interactions
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
