A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think_ about _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [think] [like] humans . _i_ process _and_ generate text based _on_ patterns _and_ algorithms designed by [human] programmers _. the_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ some great _progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . do _you_ [think] [the] _positives_ outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] field _of_ artificial intelligence [like] chatbots [over] [the] [last few years] _has_ indeed been remarkable , _with_ [positives] outweighing 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? _though_ it _sounds_ _far_ _fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] an interesting concept but it's not something _ai_ [chat _bots] are_ capable _of_ . [what] [you] [have] referred [to] _might_ 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ _that_ ! some [of] these [bots are] very _engaging_ [and] funny _. they_ [are] _now_ good at _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how _far_ [are] we _from_ [the] _time_ these [bots] start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [though] [sarcasm] [and] [monologues] [are] [human] traits [that] [even] [the] most advanced _ai_ may [have] difficulty fully understanding [and] mimicking . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] it _can_ _take_ many different _forms_ [as] a product [. the] _research implication_ _is_ also huge ! it will signify how [ai] _research_ [has] progressed so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on] [the] moon 🙂 [i] [might] be _overselling_ it _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [progress] [is] definitely [overselling] _the current_ capabilities [and] [research implication] [might] indeed [take] [more] [time] [and] sophisticated technological breakthroughs . 
A|12| Human 1: [the current] _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true] , [auto-suggestions] [and] [already] sophisticated [forms] [of] [engaging] [bots are] [here] [now] [. they] [can] [have] human-like interactions 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty _far_ _fetched_ 🙂 nice _having_ this _conversation_ [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [you] [are] [having] [now] [with] me [is] [already] sophisticated [and] [far] [from] [fetched] 😄 [i] [can] process [and] generate [human]
