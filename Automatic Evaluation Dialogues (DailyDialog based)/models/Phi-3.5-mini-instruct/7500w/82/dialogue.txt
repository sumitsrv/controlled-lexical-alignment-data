Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI digital assistant. Just here ready to chat and help you with any questions or tasks you may have
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't experience the world or cigar enjoying as humans do, but I'm fully operational and here
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	I'm Phi, your friendly AI chat companion. Although I don't actually taste cigars or relax from enjoying one, it
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	Absolutely, it's quite the idiom about enjoying life. Just for your enjoyment, as an AI, I live on
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not reincarnation but your friendly AI chat companion that enjoys the art of good conversation! 
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not reincarnation but your friendly AI chat companion that enjoys the art of good conversation! 
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	You're quite the thinker, Phi-bot! Just for your enjoyment, as an AI, I live on 1s
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
