Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	Haha, you might be 100% accurate! I'm like a robot for fun planning—I live and operate in the present
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	I can lend you the fun theme for planning, like Kale-themed Thanksgiving could be about healthy choices! 
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	I talk more as an AI, but I can not have the human like you. 
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not human, but language is something I can assist you with! 🤖 If you have your favorite computer
Human 1:	 Yes!

Human 1:	 lol
