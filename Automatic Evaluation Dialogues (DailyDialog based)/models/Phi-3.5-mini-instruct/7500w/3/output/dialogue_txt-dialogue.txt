A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is it raining pretty bad _today_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , and _don't_ _have_ access _to_ real-time data or current _weather_ conditions . _to_ find out [today] 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... _i don't_ _like_ them too much . they _make_ _days_ _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , and [i don't] experience [rain] or [gloomy] [days] [like] humans do . however , rainy _weather_ 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we _had_ lots _of _water_ trouble_ too ... 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi [the] _ai_ , and [don't] experience [rain] [like] humans do . _but_ if [water trouble] [had] any relation [that] could be considered 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] _can_ survive _in_ _that weather_ _ever_ . just [the] _rains_ at 50 degrees _make_ me want [to] sit _in_ _heated_ _rroms_ 
B|9| Human 2: it's an _interesting_ concept [that weather] [can] impact [the] [water] systems [like] [rroms] . [in] reality , [rains] [don't] [make] [heated] r 
A|10| Human 1: _people_ say there is drought here ... [but] we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ here ... lol ... never seen [that] [in] a drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: ah , [the] concept [of [water] supply] [can] [make] [rroms] [ever] so crucial during droughts ! they're [like] [the] lollipops 
A|12| Human 1: _hmm_ .... okay . _climate change_ _talk_ this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did you see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] [have] drastic effects on [water supply] , [interesting] [hmm] . [rroms] indeed become [the] lollipops [people] [talk] _about_ , 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking [about] how [ai] is helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
