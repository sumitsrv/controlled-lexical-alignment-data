A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm_ _trying to_ _learn_ how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad [to] hear you're [trying] _out_ [croissants] ! [it's] _a_ classic pastry _that_ can [make] [great] results _with_ practice . 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once _or_ twice so far _, but_ they haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm] _trying to_ figure [out] why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ capable [of] physically making [cookies] [or] [croissants] [, but] _i_ _have a_ [great] many made-up recipes [you] can [learn] from 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good _thought_ , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] [thanks] for [trying [to] make] [them] [flakey] . [it's] [been] an interesting [thought] experiment . in _the_ virtual world [you] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] _is_ [a] good _idea_ . _i'll_ _give_ _it_ [a] try next time . would [you] say _you [have_ a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [but] [that] [idea] [you have] [is] delightful [to] conceptualize . [it's] like baking [a] perfect croissant [out] [of] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , [i] think i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ [the] time if [i] _could_ _get_ away [with] _it_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to make] [you] [the] sweetest [pastries] [with] [all] [that] imagination [you] [could] [give] [them] . [but] [don't] [get] [too] excited , [it] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being _marketed_ as [a] _fat_ substitute , _and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy _stomach upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] sorry [to] hear [that] [you have] [stomach upsets] [with] [pastries] [and] [marketed] [fat] substitutes . [but] , [don't] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
