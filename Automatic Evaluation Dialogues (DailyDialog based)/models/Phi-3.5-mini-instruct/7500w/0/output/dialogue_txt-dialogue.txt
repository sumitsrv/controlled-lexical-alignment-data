B|1| Human 2: _what_ is your favorite holiday ? 
A|2| Human 1: _one_ _where_ _i_ _get to meet lots of different people_ . 
B|3| Human 2: your preference for _a_ holiday [where] _you_ [get to meet lots of different people] could be [one] [of] several types [of] events or festivals: 
A|4| Human 1: hard [to] keep [a] _count_ . maybe 25 .

A|6| Human 1: _i_ think [it] was _australia_ 
B|7| Human 2: [i] apologize for any confusion . [australia] is indeed [one] [of] _the_ countries _where people_ [meet] during various holidays like _the_ anzac day commemor 
A|8| Human 1: not _really_ . [the] _interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating_ [to] _learn_ [where people] _are_ coming _from_ _and_ [what] matters [to] _them_

A|12| Human 1: wow ! that's _interesting_ , borderline _spooky_ 
B|13| Human 2: apologies if [it] seemed [spooky] , [but it's] [really] [interesting] . [australia] [and] other countries [are] [fascinating] [where people] [from] [different] backgrounds 
A|14| Human 1: so , do [you] do _treasure hunting_ often ? 
B|15| Human 2: my apologies for any confusion ! [the] [treasure hunting] you're referring [to] here is [a] metaphorical exploration [of] australia’s cultural
