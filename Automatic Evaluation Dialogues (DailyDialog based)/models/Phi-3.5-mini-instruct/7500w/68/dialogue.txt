Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be glad to help you understand the concepts you missed in lectures. Can you tell me which topic or subject you need
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	I understand you'd like a more in-depth discussion right now. While I'm not able to have face-to-face time discuss
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	I've covered the basic concepts for now, your test preparation going how you think it should be right now 
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	You'll still have time for the test preparation over the weekend then. But here's how you may think going forward: 
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	You've got the right mindset with that course content feeling very much like its not outdated. This will help you think strategically and time
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	Thank you for the well wishes! You've given some very practical advice here that will help with time management and test preparation over the weekend
