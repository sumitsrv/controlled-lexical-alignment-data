A|4| Human 1: [my] partner's former _friend_ invited [me] _for_ lunch (they _are_ _not_ _in_ _good_ books _right_ now) . _but_ during _their_ friendship _i_ formed an independent bond [with] [the] other _person_ _because_ we _all_ used [to] hang out _a_ lot . now _i _feel_ like_ _i_ _have_ [to] _take_ sides . 
B|5| Human 2: _i'm_ [not] [a] [person] , [but] [i] understand [the] [scenario] you [are] describing _. it's_ indeed [a] delicate situation [with] emotions and friendships
