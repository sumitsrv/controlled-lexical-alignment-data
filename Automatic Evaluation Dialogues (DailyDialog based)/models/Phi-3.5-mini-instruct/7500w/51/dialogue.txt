Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I'm good, thank you! I don't watch horse racing, but I'm here to help you with any information about it or
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	It's great to hear about your friends! Gambling with money, like horse racing, can be a fun way to socialize but it
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	It's usually fish that call the deep sea home, but I wouldn't like getting part of with their favorite fishing spots haha
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually going with friends on that deep sea fishing trip. It's been a long time since we tried any fun activities like that
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Not often but I'm very excited about going fishing with you and friends once before. It seems like fun, good sea breeze,
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo's the city I'd like you to prefer because its vibrant culture and top-tier sushi scene far exceed New
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I've never been there either but the idea itself sounds like quite an adventure. Tokyo with its iconic temples, bustling city
