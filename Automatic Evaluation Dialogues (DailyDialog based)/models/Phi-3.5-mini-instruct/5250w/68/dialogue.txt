Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	Of course! I'd be happy to help you understand the concepts you missed in lectures. Can you tell me which subjects or topics you'
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	While I'm not able to have face-to-face discussions, I can definitely help you now! Tell me the slides or concepts
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	I'm your friendly AI, not test preparation person! However, I understand the time you have for this now. 
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	Absolutely! I'll help you organize your study time effectively over the weekend. 
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	Fantastic! This will help your preparation for the course content that's very much research-oriented. 
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	You're very considerate! This weekend will be well invested with your help.
