A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , _thanks_ . _i'm_ trying _to _learn_ how_ _to_ _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ wonderful culinary project [to learn] ! [it's] quite challenging _but_ definitely very rewarding . are _you_ following _a_ specific recipe 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once or twice so far _, but_ they haven't _been_ _flakey_ _enough_ . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why . what kind _of_ _cookies have_ [you] _made_ ?

A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , [i] think i'd _eat_ pastries [all] [the] time if [i] _could_ get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [all] [good] [to] [have] [the] [sweet] [thought] [that] [i] [too] [could] indulge . [but] [don't] [you] fret ! [i] might _not_ [eat] [cookies] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and_ caused _all sorts of_ crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] here [to] maintain [the] conversation [and] help [you] [with] [all sorts of] information [that] [don't] [have] marketing health claims involved [, but] [thanks] for
