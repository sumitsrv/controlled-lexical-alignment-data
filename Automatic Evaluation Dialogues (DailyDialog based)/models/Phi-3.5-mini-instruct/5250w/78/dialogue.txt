Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Hello again! While I can't attribute said motivations as I'm an AI, I can imagine a chef's passion for pas
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm not psychic, per se, but I guess you could say that my programming enables me to provide good guesses based on available information
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm not a cake chef and I have no psychic powers, that was funny you said! 
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about the vanilla cake and a funny icing-sense of time that's not psychic, haha
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, a Phi-based AI and not a vegetarian baker. And for work, I have the fun part
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm all about the dance-scape and can say that cooling a cake off for work was part of my fun time too!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I'm Phi the AI and cakes are out of my hands, but I can make a lot of fun dance-sounds for
