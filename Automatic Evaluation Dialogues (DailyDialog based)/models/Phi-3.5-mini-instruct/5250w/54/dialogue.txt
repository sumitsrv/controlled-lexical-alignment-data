Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't have feelings or game experiences, but I'm here and fully functional, just like you won your ping
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	It's great that you won! I might not experience triumphs, but I can certainly help you celebrate by providing tips for pingpong
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just your standard game for you, very good at providing assistance but not great at pingpong. What's your favourite kind
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm just like you with your context clues game. 
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm just your friendly virtual assistant, so physicality isn't part of my game. 
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I'm Phi for you! While I don't play physical games like tennis, pingpong, or athletic feats, it
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
