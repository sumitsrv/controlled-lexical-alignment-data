Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI language model. While human chat bots like you, interacting with an AI, offer
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	Indeed, the progress made over recent years in human chat bots like me have been significant and some positives are notable:
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	Indeed progress like the impersorsination you mentioned sounds far out – but let's chat about some positives I think have made human-like
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	They have made great progress in engaging and giving the semblance of human-like responses that are funny and even some time very insightful
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	Absolutely! The implication and progress here are huge. They signify how far AI can understand the human language more like a moon landing
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The moon landings and the progress in auto-suggestions are different, yet you can think about the wonder these milestones have brought to
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	I think you might have the funny bone with your creative analogies 🌍 The moon landings and progress in auto-suggestions
