Human 2:	That sounds exciting! Microkitchen events are a great way to connect with local producers and chefs. They often offer fresh ingredients
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Indeed, jackets are essential for staying warm in cold weather. While microkitchen goodies typically don't include outdoor gear,
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Absolutely, weather plays its part in our daily activities. It's the good microkitchen outlines that get us through even the cold
