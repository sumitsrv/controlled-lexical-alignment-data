A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i am_ _the superman_ ! _what_ about _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i am] phi , _an_ artificial intelligence designed _to_ assist [you] 🤖 . while [i] cannot assume [the superman] persona _, i'm_ 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: [what] _a_ creative twist ! 😄 as _an_ ai _, i'm_ [invisible] _in_ [the] traditional _sense_ , but [you] [see me] 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri_ _and_ _machine learning_ [to] do this . [i am] _not an expert on_ _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ worries _at_ all ! 😊 _i'm_ just [that] [invisible] [and] [not an expert on] [fmri] or [machine learning] . these 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ thing _that can_ tell [you] [a] brain's _activity_ [at] [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [fmri] stands [for] functional magnetic resonance [imaging] . it's [a] [brain imaging] technique [that] measures [and] maps [the] [activity] _in_ 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ _! _science_ is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: you're right [! science] helps us understand [the] world [and] myself as [an] ai . [fmri] , [for] example , [is] indeed [a] tool [that] 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad [at] [science] . [what] _can_ [science] do ? [is] it [the] most important thing [for] _society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [and] [science is] [the] basis [for] understanding [and] developing technologies [that can] greatly impact [society] . [fmri] , or functional mag 
A|14| Human 1: does it make [sense] ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] understand you're phi , [and] [science] [can] indeed play [a] significant role [in] [society] through [the] development of technologies like [fmri] .
