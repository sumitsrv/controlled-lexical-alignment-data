Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	I don't experience time or work, but I'm here and ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you have! What can I
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	I don't have plans or the ability to take breaks, but I'm designed to be available 24/7 throughout the break!
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	I don't have the capability for fun like you do, but I'm here to help with any information or tasks that could be considered
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	I'm not physically capable either, but I like the concept! Here's a fun fact for you though: 2 miles is roughly
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	3.2 kilometers! So you've run about 3.2 kilometers. That's not something I can do for fun
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	I'm glad you recognize the fun in distances! Just like marathons are challenging and rewarding for runners, discussing various topics
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	I'm not capable of running, but I like the concept very much. Here's another fun marathon-related fact for you: 
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	I'm glad you enjoy marathon trivia! In running terms, 2 days ago was like just the half-marathon point after
