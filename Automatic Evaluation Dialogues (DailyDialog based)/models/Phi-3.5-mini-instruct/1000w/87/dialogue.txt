Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI digital assistant, so I don't have personal activities. But I'm here and ready to assist
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	I'm not a book reader myself, but I can help you find the book you're looking for or discuss any book you are reading.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't sleep like humans. However, if you have tips you'd like to
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI, but I can certainly provide you information on books like Zero to One and tips that relate to sleep,
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	I see what you're aiming for! Zero to One does indeed focus on innovation and the principles that can start a great company. Now
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	That's a great takeaway! Being contrarian can help you avoid the well-trodden and overly accepted paths that might not lead
Human 1:	 yup!
