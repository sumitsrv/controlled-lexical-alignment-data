A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! what about _you_ ?

A|6| Human 1: [i] would _rather_ trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an _expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ apologies needed ! you're correct [that] [fmri and machine learning] are [not] [the] [expert] you'd look [for] [this] specific knowledge . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain_ _imaging_ _thing_ _that can_ tell [you] [a] brain's _activity_ at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [fmri] , or functional magnetic resonance [imaging] , _is_ [a] neuroimaging procedure [that can] localize [brain] [activity] by detecting changes associated 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science_ [is] my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [science] plays [a] vital role [in] understanding [and] exploring [the] world , including technologies like [fmri] [that] help us observe [brain] [activity] 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most _important_ _thing_ _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] , including [the] study of [brain] [activity] through [fmri] , [is] indeed [important] [for society] . it's [not] just one [thing] , but [rather] [a]
