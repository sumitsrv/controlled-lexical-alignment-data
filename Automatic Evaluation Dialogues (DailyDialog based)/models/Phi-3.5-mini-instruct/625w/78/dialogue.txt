Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	You clearly have a sense of humor! I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have personal aspirations
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?

Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	Keep the puns coming! I work with data-laced icing and 24/7 functionality, trying not to make a cake
