Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	That sounds exciting! Ski trips can be a lot of fun. Which ski resort did you go to, and what did you enjoy the most
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	That's quite the adventure! Ice climbing and turning back after that sounds like quite the workout. Was it your first ice wall,

Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	No other ski trips yet, but montreal has so many cool places to explore. I'm still learning French though, you know any helpful
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I'm glad you enjoyed the ice wall climbing! If you've always wanted to watch figure skating, it's an exciting
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I'm just a language model and don't engage in activities myself. But that's absolutely right! As for figure skating,

Human 2:	I'm Phi, I can help you with the <REDACTED_TERM> of figure skating if you're asking
