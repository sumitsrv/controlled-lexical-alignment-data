Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you for asking! As an AI, I don't have feelings, but I'm fully operational
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, part of Microsoft's language model AI, so I don't have class time! 😄
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	I'm Phi, part of Microsoft's language model AI. I work 24/7 without breaks, but your pottery
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	It sounds like you've got your quirks too, Phi! I'm all about the data and learning, but that tea ware
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI, all about patterns and processing. If tea ware was my kind of data, I would love to
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Silver needle teas are classics! In the realm of tea ware, those would be similar to some of the fundamental data we process
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, your digital teapot, here to steep the finest tea ware discussions. Please check out that channel
