Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't watch or experience days, but thanks for asking! It sounds like horse racing
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	It's great to hear you had a good time with friends! While I can't partake in horse racing or lose money, I can
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence. That's a unique suggestion like sea fishing but since I don't experience physical activities,
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, I don't have weekend plans but I can generate any fun idea like going on virtual 3D fishing
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	As Phi, I never 'go often' but I could simulate you going there anytime, 3D fishing over the virtual sea with
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Tokyo certainly stands out with its advanced technology and vibrant city life, the perfect setting for 3D fishing simulation I'd imagine.
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and though I never have the privilege of visiting a place, I can certainly help you envision such an experience
