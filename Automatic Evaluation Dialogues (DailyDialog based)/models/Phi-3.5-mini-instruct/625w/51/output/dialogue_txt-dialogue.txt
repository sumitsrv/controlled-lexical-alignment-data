B|1| Human 2: hey ! how's your day _been ?_ 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _good_ ! _i_ spent most _of_ _it_ watching _horse racing_ . how about yourself ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , _an_ ai , so [i] don't watch or experience days _, but_ thanks for asking _! it_ sounds _like_ [horse racing] 
A|4| Human 1: [i] actually [like] _to_ put down some _money [,_ _but] i_ wouldn't call [it] my favorite part , _since i_ usually _lose_ [it] ... haha . catching up _with friends_ is _great_ ! how long _had_ [it] [been ?] 
B|5| Human 2: [it's] [great] [to] _hear_ _you_ [had] a [good] _time_ [with friends] ! while [i] can't partake in [horse racing] or [lose] [money _,] i_ can 
A|6| Human 1: [i'm] thinking _of_ _going_ deep _sea fishing_ . ever tried that before ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _an_ artificial intelligence . that's a unique suggestion [like] [sea fishing] [but] [since i] don't experience physical activities , 
A|8| Human 1: just once ! [i] got super [sea] sick .. haha _have_ _any fun_ _weekend plans_ yourself ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi _, i_ don't [have] [weekend plans] [but i] can generate [any fun] idea [like] [going] on virtual 3d [fishing] 
A|10| Human 1: oh very cool . [i] [hear] _its_ nice _over_ _there_ . do [you] go often ? 
B|11| Human 2: _as_ phi _, i_ _never_ 'go often' [but i] could simulate [you] [going] [there] anytime , 3d [fishing] [over] _the_ virtual [sea] [with] 
A|12| Human 1: new york is [the] top _of_ my list because my family lives [there] ! [as] far [as] [the] _city_ itself _though_ ... [i] think _i'd_ prefer someplace outside _of_ [the] us , [like] _tokyo_ . what about [you] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [tokyo] certainly stands out [with] [its] advanced technology and vibrant [city] life , [the] perfect setting for 3d [fishing] simulation [i'd] imagine . 
A|14| Human 1: oh i've [never] [been] [! it] is _such an_ iconic _place , i_ [have] [to] make [the] [time] [to] get [there] soon . 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] phi , and [though] [i] [never] [have] [the] privilege [of] visiting a [place , i] can certainly help [you] envision [such an] experience
