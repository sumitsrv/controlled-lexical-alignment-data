A|12| Human 1: oh wow ! sounds fancy ! [what] _is_ that _about_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: neurips stands for [the] neural information processing systems conference . it's [all] [about] artificial intelligence research – [something] [i'm] well- 
A|14| Human 1: oh , ml ? 
B|15| Human 2: _i_ [see] ! machine learning [is] indeed [a] fascinating field that's [all] [about] helping systems improve [with] [more] data , [just] like [a basketball] [team] learning 
A|16| Human 1: _ahh_ ! [i] saw [a] scary _movie about_ that once . it was [about] this _sentient_ [ai] [in] [a] dystopian future - very very creepy . it was called _wall-e_ , ever heard of it ? 
B|17| Human 2: [ahh] , that's [more] [wall-e] [the] [movie about] scrapheaps and [sentient] drones rather than neurips !
