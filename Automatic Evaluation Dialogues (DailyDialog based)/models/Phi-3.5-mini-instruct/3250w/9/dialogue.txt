Human 2:	I can see the holly-jolly eco-friendly and festive outlook you have too! It's very responsible not just
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target often has deals and can have eco-friendly tree options like real Christmas trees that you can return for the next year's decor
Human 1:	 Great, I hope you find a nice tree.
