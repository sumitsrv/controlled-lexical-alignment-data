Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	Nice to meet you too! That's a flavorful choice. Stirfry is a versatile and healthy dish that allows
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	That's another tasty preference! If you love ice cream, Asian Stirfry can definitely be complemented with a sweet treat
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Cookies and Cream would be fantastic too! That's creaminess from chocolate ice cream blended with the crunch
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	Food and drinks like ice cream and stirfry can certainly make any meal more enjoyable. 
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	Certainly! Food and afterlife topics are vast and quite interesting. 
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal experiences or supernatural encounters like humans would. However, I can understand and process stories
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
