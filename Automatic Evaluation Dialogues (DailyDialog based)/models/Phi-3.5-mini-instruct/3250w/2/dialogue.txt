Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence, so I don't have feelings or do
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I don't have friendships the way humans do, but you can think of this as like having a fun back-and-forth conversation
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	Oh no, you'd never say awkward with the Phi! When it's time for this conversation, it's like winding
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Ohh, the life updates you'd really like to hear are purely hypothetical since I do not exist in your 3D world.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Ohhh how exciting! Imagine the adventures you'd embark on - maybe going for long winding walks, like your life
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	As your assistant, you'd have exciting adventures like any bull riding but more along the lines of data riding and code challeng
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Saturday for me typically involves more like 256-bit encryption riding, neural network wallowing, and sometimes deep-learning bull
