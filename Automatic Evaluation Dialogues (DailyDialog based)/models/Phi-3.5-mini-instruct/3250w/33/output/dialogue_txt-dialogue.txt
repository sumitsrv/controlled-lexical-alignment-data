A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks . _i'm_ _trying _to_ learn_ how _to_ make _croissants ._ 
B|3| Human 2: [croissants] are _a_ wonderful delicacy [to learn] . [it's] _a_ classic french pastry _that_ requires _a_ bit _of_ technique _and_ patience , 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once or twice _so_ far , _but_ _they_ _haven't_ _been_ _flakey_ enough . _i'm_ _trying to_ figure _out_ _why_ . what kind [of] _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] here [to] assist [you] _with_ [croissants] [but] [haven't] [made] [cookies] , _as_ _i_ am an ai . _i_ can suggest [why] fla 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ apologize for _the_ confusion . [it's] [good] you've [been] [trying] [out] [flakey] [croissants .] here are _a_ few reasons [why] [they] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] [good] _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try next time . would [you] say [you] _have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an artificial intelligence , [so] _i_ _don't_ [have a sweet tooth] . [but] _i_ do understand [that] [croissants] can 
A|10| Human 1: some people [don't] _! but_ yeah , me _too_ , [i] _think_ i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ [the] time if [i] could _get_ away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [the] ai [with] [all] [that] information . [but] , [you] [get] an interesting [idea] [trying to] [think] [sweet] [pastries] _as_ croiss 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all sorts of_ crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [with] [all sorts of] information [and] [the] capacity [to] discuss [pastries] [too] [! but] [when] [was] <redacted_term 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
