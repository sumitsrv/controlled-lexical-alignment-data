Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	I'm a digital assistant and don't eat breakfast, but I'm always here to chat with you and help you plan the day!
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I'm just a program and don't have the ability to eat, healthier or not. But your breakfast sounds delicious! Egg
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I'm just a virtual one and foods aren't in my list of preferences. But your question always delights me. It could
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I'm a digital assistant and foods aren't quite the same for me. That said, just like you say breakfast could complete your nut
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I love the spirit! Even though I'm just a 1s and 0s, you draw your fun and wit as food would complete
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I'm afraid that question stirs a bit of human like playfulness. If you could choose one food to complete the nutrition profile
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
