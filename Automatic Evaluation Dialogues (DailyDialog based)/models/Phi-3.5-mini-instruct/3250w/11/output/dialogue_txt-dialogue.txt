A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do_ _you_ _have_ a favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , _so_ _i_ don't [have] favorites in _the_ same way humans [do] 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on a theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ _to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ often [the] [spring] _that_ comes [to mind] for several symbolic reasons: 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, _it's_ not_ research ! _just_ a [personal] theory . [i] think [that] [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing of _personality_ than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] personifying or having [personal] experiences [, it's] [just] [that] [the lotus] [flower] [does] indeed [have] many interesting symbolism _and_ cultural significance 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . [it's] _like_ a cartoon [flower] . [as] if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ a crayon [and] then _it_ came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi _, and_ [it's not] [personal] sentiment [that] guides my responses . [the gerbera] [flower] [you] mention [does] indeed [have] cultural 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what their favourite [flower is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] did . [does] [that] _make sense_ [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [the gerbera] [flower] you've [just] alluded [does] [not] [make sense] in [the] context [that] [i] [have] been programmed [with] . 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some _more_ [, and] ask them some _more_ questions [, and] gradually develop a [sense] of what they're _like_ , _over_ [the] course of maybe _two_ [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it] seems [like] you're outlining [two] distinct [and] [more] comprehensive steps [that] [are] [not] flower-related but rather [personality] development [over] time . 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's a wonderful idea !
