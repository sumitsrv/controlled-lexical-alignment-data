Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, so I don't have favorites in the same way humans do
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	The lotus flower is often the spring that comes to mind for several symbolic reasons:
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm not personifying or having personal experiences, it's just that the lotus flower does indeed have many interesting symbolism and cultural significance
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and it's not personal sentiment that guides my responses. The gerbera flower you mention does indeed have cultural
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	The gerbera flower you've just alluded does not make sense in the context that I have been programmed with. 
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	It seems like you're outlining two distinct and more comprehensive steps that are not flower-related but rather personality development over time.
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
