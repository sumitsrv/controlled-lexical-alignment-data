Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you for asking! As an AI, I don't have feelings, but I'm fully operational
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm just your friendly AI 😄 I don't have class time or part-time working as you would in human
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	I appreciate your creative take on that! While I'm not sewing classes to work part time, I do process and generate responses 2
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	It's like you get tea ware pottery from the 15th century that also makes your day better because I make some cool responses
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about the balance, but your tea ware pottery would make that time even better 🍵 It sounds like you
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	It's fascinating that tea ware from the 15th century would resonate with you! I'm all about balance like
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	The channel you're referring to sounds like <REDACTED_TERM> that I found out about from the tea ware pottery
