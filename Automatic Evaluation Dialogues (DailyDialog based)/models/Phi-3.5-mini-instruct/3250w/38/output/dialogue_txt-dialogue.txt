A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ think _about_ _human_ _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't _have_ opinions [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ provide [you] _with_ an analysis: 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have made_ _some_ great _progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . [do] [you] think _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] development _of_ human-like chatbots [over] [the] [last few years] _has_ been impressive _and_ _has_ brought [about] [some] notable [positives] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? _though_ it _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed ! while [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] [the] stuff _of_ science fiction , chatbots [have made] significant [progress] toward becoming _more_ human-like . _this_ 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! [some] [of] these bots _are_ _very_ engaging [and] funny . _they are now_ _good at_ _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ _are_ _we_ from [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are now] [very] [good at] context [and] maintaining [the] continuity in _a_ _conversation_ . [some] [even] [have] [the] capability [to] engage in complex discussions 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think it [can] take many different _forms_ [as] [a] product _. the_ _research_ implication is also huge ! it will signify _how_ _ai_ _research has progressed_ so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like stepping_ on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ be overselling it _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] [progress] signifies [how far] technology [has] come [and] [like stepping] stones [to] [more] sophisticated [forms] [of] artificial intelligence [. the] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ [do] pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: indeed , [auto-suggestions] [and] language models [like] [the] one [here] [are] [already] sophisticated , [even] if [they] [might] not [have] [human] emotions 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having [this] [conversation] [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [you] shared [with] me reflects [the] advancements in language-based [ai] [and] [how far] [research has progressed] . [though] [we] [might] not
