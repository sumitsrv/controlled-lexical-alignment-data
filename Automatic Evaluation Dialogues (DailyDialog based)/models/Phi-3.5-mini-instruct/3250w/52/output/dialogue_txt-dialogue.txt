A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ doing today ? 
A|2| Human 1: i heard _they are_ _giving out_ _some_ _goodies_ _in_ _microkitchen_ . 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _that_ sounds delightful . while microkitchens [are] not [giving out] [goodies] , [they are] indeed efficient spaces perfect _for_ small-scale cook 
A|4| Human 1: i guess _its_ _a jacket_ ! _very much needed_ [that] _in_ _the cold_ 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: absolutely , [a jacket] _can_ be [very much needed] during _cold weather_ . if [the] [microkitchen] analogy was _to_ emphasize [that] [some] items 
A|6| Human 1: sure hate it ! limits _our_ ability [to] go [out] _even_ [for] [a] _walk_ ! _its_ _good that_ we don't _get_ [to] suffer _extreme_ [cold weather] ! 
B|7| Human 2: it's [good that] [the] [jacket] metaphor emphasizes [our] need [for] outdoor activities [even] [in] [cold weather] . just as [a] [microkitchen] 
A|8| Human 1: oh nice _! where_ did _you live before_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: indeed [! where] [you live before] _can_ influence [the] outdoor activities [that] [are] accessible _and_ [the cold] weather's impact on those activities . 
A|10| Human 1: _new york_ ! nice ! best place [to] [live] 🙂 .. right , except [for] [the cold] ! 
B|11| Human 2: [new york] , with [its] [cold] winters , definitely presents [some] challenges [for] outdoor activities . however , [the] weather's [extreme] does not deter 
A|12| Human 1: anyways , i guess we should _better_ _hurry_ up _to get_ [the] [goodies] . i remember last time [they] ran [out] of it . 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely , [the [cold] weather] often leads [to] [a] [hurry] [for] outdoor enthusiasts [to get] their gear [before] they're [needed] . 
A|14| Human 1: [the] one [in] [our] floor . i will [get] by _your desk and_ we [can] _walk there_ . 
B|15| Human 2: it's always [better] [to] [walk there] [for] [our] 7 am meeting rather than [get] [out] [your desk and] [the cold] [can] be quite bothersome
