Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Hello! That sounds delightful. While microkitchens are not giving out goodies, they are indeed efficient spaces perfect for small-scale cook
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Absolutely, a jacket can be very much needed during cold weather. If the microkitchen analogy was to emphasize that some items
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	It's good that the jacket metaphor emphasizes our need for outdoor activities even in cold weather. Just as a microkitchen
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Indeed! Where you live before can influence the outdoor activities that are accessible and the cold weather's impact on those activities. 
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	New York, with its cold winters, definitely presents some challenges for outdoor activities. However, the weather's extreme does not deter
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Absolutely, the cold weather often leads to a hurry for outdoor enthusiasts to get their gear before they're needed.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	It's always better to walk there for our 7 AM meeting rather than get out your desk and the cold can be quite bothersome
