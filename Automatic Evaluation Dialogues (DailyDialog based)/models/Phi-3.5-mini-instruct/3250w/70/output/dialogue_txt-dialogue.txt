B|13| Human 2: _it's_ [still] impressive that _you can_ [play] [chords] [well] [for] [this] [long] ! while [the] barre [chords are] indeed known [to] be challenging 
A|14| Human 1: that's true . [it's] [like] [the] alphabets [in] [a] [language] _. once you know them , you can pretty much_ write word 
B|15| Human 2: exactly ! [it's] [the] [language] [of music] [for] [guitar [.] once you know them , you can pretty much] [play] [chords] [like] reading [a] book .
