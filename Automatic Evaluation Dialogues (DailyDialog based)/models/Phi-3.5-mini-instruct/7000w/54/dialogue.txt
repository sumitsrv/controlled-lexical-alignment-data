Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to assist you with information or tasks about pingpong or any other game!
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	It's great that you won! I'm glad for your success. Congratulations! What did you think about your game, and how
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just a digital assistant, so I don't play games for enjoyment, but I can still talk about game design or strategy.
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm glad you brought that up! It's a ball game very like pingpong but with some unique elements. 
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	It's physical but with very specific rules that distinguish racquetball. 
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I'm just your friendly virtual assistant and don't play physical sports for fun. However, I can help with racquetball game strategies
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
