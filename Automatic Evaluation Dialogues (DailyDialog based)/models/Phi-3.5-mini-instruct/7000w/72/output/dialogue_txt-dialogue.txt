A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ _reflect_ back _too_ much _on_ things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been_ _very_ favorable _for_ me in terms of _time_ spent _with family and friends_ _and _work_ life balance_ . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm glad _to_ hear [you] [reflect] [and] [have been] able _to_ enjoy [time] [with family and friends] while maintaining [work life balance] [for] 201 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! good _idea_ [to] _help_ _people_ figuring out their new [year] resolutions 🙂 so _how_ do _i_ _get a fresher outlook_ ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: here's [how] [you] can [get a fresher outlook] [for] 2021 [and] beyond: 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ ! _i_ think _the idea_ _does_ [have] some potential . [how] did [you] _come up with_ [this] _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: while [i] [don't] [have] [the] ability [to] [come up with] ideas myself , _that's_ [a] [very] inspiring [and] actionable [outlook] [for] 2 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] is _valuable_ _help_ [for] [the] community . [i] think _mental health_ is _one_ of [the] bigger _challenges_ facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: absolutely , [mental health] [and] work-life [balance] are critical [for] one's overall well-being . [the idea] you've outlined 
A|10| Human 1: _that_ is _actually_ [a] _quote_ stolen _from_ my tl when [i] joined my first _company_ after graduation . [i] guess _now_ after 5 yrs of [work] _experience_ , [i] fully agree [with] _it_ 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: _that's_ [actually] [valuable] [experience] [for] [you] [now] [and] [the idea] stems [from] firsthand [experience] [with] [company] dynamics [and work] [challenges] [that] millions [have] faced [too] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] think [family and friends] _play_ [a] big _role_ here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] new stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... so _on_ 🙂 [what] about [you] ? is there [a] _right answer_ [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: there's no [one] [right answer] [that] fits everyone [for] [life] [and work] [balance] , as [it] greatly depends [on] individual values , circumstances , [and] goals . [that] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! [that's] [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also _music_ earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: absolutely ! [what] [role] [does] [music] [play] [for] [you] [and] [how] [does] [it] [help] [with] [balance] or [mental health] ? 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am [actually] not much of [a] reader . [i] usually hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ _reading_ _books_ corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] an interesting [quote] [and] stance ! [books] can certainly [help] [with] [mental health] [for] many [people] , as [reading] can _be a_ [great] way [to] dest 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! [it] may turn out [to] [be a] best seller :)
