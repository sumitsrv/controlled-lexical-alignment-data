A|4| Human 1: glad _to_ hear you're _better_ . sorry _to_ hear _you_ _were_ sick . [i] _was_ sick _a_ couple of weeks ago _with_ _a_ bad cough _. there's_ _definitely_ _a_ bug [going] _around_ . admit [i] _just_ want _to stay _healthy_ for_ _the holidays_ _and_ _plan_ _to_ relax . 
B|5| Human 2: it's [definitely] [better] [for] [you] [and] [the holidays] [to stay healthy] . there [were] concerns [with] sickness [around] [your] location [was] [well] justified 
A|6| Human 1: [definitely] _! i_ _know_ _a_ lot of folks travel [for] [the holidays] , [but] [i'm] happy [to stay] home _myself_ !

B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [the] ai [and] _that_ sounds [very festive] [too] [! but] [you] [know] , [for] us , [holidays] or _not_ , [well] 
A|12| Human 1: buying _a_ _tree_ is _a_ neat [experience] . [i] [was] torn between buying [an] artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . _a_ real one [that] smells _like_ fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] one [that] we _can_ _disassemble_ every year . 
B|13| Human 2: [that's] [very] pragmatic [and] [eco-friendly] [! i] [can] appreciate [the] yearly [disassemble] [for] [tree] disposal [which] [also] 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , [very] clever pun [! i] _like_ it ! depends . [i] remember having real christmas _trees_ _from_ childhood , [but] these [days] [with] _climate change_ , [i] think [not] chopping down _a_ [tree] [just] [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in _a_ month is [the] _more responsible_ thing [to] [do .] 
B|15| Human 2: indeed , [the] [eco-friendly] approach [not] only conserves [trees] [but] [also] [more responsible] [from] [a] [climate change] [and] waste reduction perspective [. there's] 
A|16| Human 1: admit my favorite store is _target_ , plus they often [have] good deals . 
B|17| Human 2: [target] [and] other [eco-friendly] [tree] options [like] potted [trees] [that] [can] be planted outdoors after [the holidays] or artificial [trees] 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i] hope [you] find [a] nice [tree] .
