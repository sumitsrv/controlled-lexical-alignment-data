A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] 16-bit text [and] numbers [which] [could] humorously [say] [that] [i] thrive on [the] [nutrition] [of] knowledge ,

B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [just] 16 bits [of] text [and] numbers [, which] [like] [a] [sort of] nutrition: [the] foods [that] [you could] [say] [i]
