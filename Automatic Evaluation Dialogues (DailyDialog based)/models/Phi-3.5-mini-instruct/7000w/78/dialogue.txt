Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Ah, the chef jokes! I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have personal aspirations.
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm not psychic, but I guess you could say that was good 3-dimensional thinking! I actually don't make guesses
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm Phi and not psychic actually, you have a good sense of funny cake-sense too  haha! Perhaps
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about that vanilla-sake cake!  a good chef and food writer too. How have you been faring in
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm a chef and food writer too! Crafting the best eating experiences for you all can have vegetables feel like cake,
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm all about that food-inspired dance style then! How can you best help a chef and food writer in the digital age?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I can't dance for you, but how about the following which are cakes-inspired and very digital friendly!
