Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	It's great to have you here! While I'm the digital superman 🦸‍♂️ of information and assistance,
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	You're absolutely right! 🌟 I may not see you visually, but rest assured, I'm invisible when it comes
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	No worries at all! You're the expert for this interaction 😄 If you would like to delve into fMRI
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	fMRI, or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, can tell you that! The brain's activity and the blood flowing
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	Science can be pretty powerful and exciting 😄 fMRI helps us see brain activity non-invasively by detecting changes
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	Science can be pretty powerful and exciting! fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) indeed plays a crucial role
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	I apologize for the confusion. fMRI can indeed make sense. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
