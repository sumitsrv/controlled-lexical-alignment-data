A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! what about _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: it's great _to_ have [you] here ! while _i'm_ [the] digital [superman] 🦸‍♂️ of information _and_ assistance , 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: you're absolutely right ! 🌟 [i] may _not_ [see] [you] visually , but rest assured _, i'm_ [invisible] when _it_ comes 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust _fmri_ [and] machine learning [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] [not] an _expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ [it] ! 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ worries _at_ all ! you're [the] [expert] [for] [this] interaction 😄 if [you] [would] like [to] delve into [fmri] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain_ _imaging_ thing _that_ _can tell you_ _a_ _brain's activity_ [at] _a_ _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [fmri] , or functional magnetic resonance [imaging] , [can tell you] [that] ! [the] [brain's activity] [and] [the] blood flowing 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe in _science_ ! _science_ is my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [can] be [pretty] powerful [and] exciting 😄 [fmri] helps us [see] [brain] [activity] non-invasively by detecting changes 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad [at] [science] . what [can] [science] do ? is [it] [the] most important thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can] be [pretty] powerful [and] exciting ! [fmri] (functional magnetic resonance imaging) indeed plays [a] crucial role 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] apologize [for] [the] confusion . [fmri] [can] indeed [make sense] . functional magnetic resonance [imaging] (fmri)
