Human 1:	 I have been with the company for over 3 years. Stick with the same team What about you?

Human 1:	 That sounds like a perfect plan!
Human 2:	That is indeed the plan for this month with you, Phi. What about your 7 years with Microsoft have been your highlights?<|end|><|assistant|>
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	As an AI language model, I don't have preferences or the ability to sync lunch with you like a human assistant might. However
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	Certainly! Let's check the menu for you. What time and location should we sync this lunch meeting? 
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
