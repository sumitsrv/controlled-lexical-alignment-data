Human 2:	1. Knowledge Sharing: Mentees have the chance to learn from the mentor's experience and wisdom. A good mentor
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	Absolutely, peer perspective can sometimes offer diverse insights and innovative ideas. 1:1 mentorship certainly provides personalized guidance but
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	1:1 mentorship certainly provides personalized guidance but peer perspective can sometimes offer diverse insights you plan to focus on the mentee
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	Communication skills are certainly key to success in any field. What have been some of the significant improvements you've noticed with this mentorship?
