Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	That sounds exhilarating! I can only imagine the breathtaking views from the ski slopes. Are you back safe and ready
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	Oh no! I'm glad that ha-ha came after and that you're back on your feet. icy wall falls can be quite
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	I know that ice and skiing got you slammed but french came back after a cool 30 years haha. Language just gets better
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	No, but I used that french slang you know 😄 and just came back from the ski school high adrenaline
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I've skimmed the Olympics and figure skating Youtube videos! Did you know any cool ice skating tricks that used slang
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I can't pull myself along the sides just like that 😅 but you've got a great sense of humor! Olympic figure
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, but don't worry, I can skate you along the good vibes and knowledge ��
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
