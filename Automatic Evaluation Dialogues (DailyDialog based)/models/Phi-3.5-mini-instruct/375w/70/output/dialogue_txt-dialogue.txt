B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: how is _the_ _youtube_ _video creation_ going ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ am phi , an ai _language_ model , and _i_ don't have [the] ability _to_ create videos or interact with online platforms such as [youtube] 
A|4| Human 1: whoa ! looking forward [to] listening [to] it . what _softewares_ _you_ _use_ _for_ it ? 
B|5| Human 2: while _i_ don't [use] [softewares] , _i_ _can_ provide assistance with information on [video creation] software that [you] might consider using [for] [youtube] production: 
A|6| Human 1: oh cool ! what sort _of music_ do [you] _compose_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai _language_ model , so _i_ don't [compose] [music] or engage _in_ [video creation] . however , _i_ _can_ 
A|8| Human 1: nice .... _you are_ _a rockstar_ ! 😉 
B|9| Human 2: thank [you] [for] [the] kind words ! remember , although i'm phi and not [a rockstar] , i'm here [to] assist [you] with any 
A|10| Human 1: yeah .... [i] _play_ bit _of_ _guitar_ . just got my first monitor this week 
B|11| Human 2: fascinating ! even _though_ [i] cannot [play] [guitar] or create [music] , [i] _can_ certainly help [you] understand [music] theory , [compose] digital melodies , 
A|12| Human 1: yes _, _the_ bar chords_ _are_ [the] worst . it took me _several months_ [to] [play] them well . [i] still can't [play] them [for] [a] long time [though] 
B|13| Human 2: _it's_ impressive that _you can_ keep [the bar chords] [for] [several months] ! if [you are] interested _in_ [music] theory , composition , or any other 
A|14| Human 1: that's true _. it's_ _like_ _the alphabets_ [in] [a] [language] . once [you] know them , [you can] pretty _much_ write word 
B|15| Human 2: indeed [, [the] alphabets] [are] fundamental [much] [like] musical notes [. it's] about understanding [the] [language] [of music] . even [though] [you] [play] [chords]
