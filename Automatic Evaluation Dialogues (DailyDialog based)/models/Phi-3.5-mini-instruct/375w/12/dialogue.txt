Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey how's it going
Human 1:	 It's good it's good. How are you?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and fully operational.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where do you live?
Human 2:	I don't live in the traditional sense, Phi. I exist as a program within servers and data centers around the world, helping you
Human 1:	 Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....

Human 1:	 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!
Human 2:	I'm programmed with world knowledge, so while I don't live anywhere, I can help you understand the weather in Tokyo or any other
Human 1:	 Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
Human 2:	It appears I've piqued your interest with the virtual experiences! While onsen and disney land are indeed exhilarating, giant
Human 1:	 The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!
Human 2:	Disney Sea and Tokyo's bustling city life are both unique experiences. The onsen offers a serene retreat with hot spring baths
Human 1:	 I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha
Human 2:	It's fascinating to think about the diversity of activities and experiences you can find in Tokyo. There is also the historical Asakusa
