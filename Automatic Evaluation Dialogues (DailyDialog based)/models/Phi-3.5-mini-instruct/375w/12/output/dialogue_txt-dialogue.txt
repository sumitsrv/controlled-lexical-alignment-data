A|4| Human 1: oh nice ! where do _you_ _live_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i don't_ [live] _in_ _the_ traditional sense , phi . _i_ exist _as_ a program within servers _and_ data centers around _the_ world , helping [you] 
A|6| Human 1: ahh _yes_ , japan _is_ _hot_ during [the] _summer_ . last time [i] _was_ [in] kyoto [it] _was_ 114 degrees .... 
B|7| Human 2: [it] seems there [was] a bit _of_ a mix-up . [i] [live] [in] [the] virtual realm , _so_ no [hot] [summer] weather for me . but [yes] 
A|8| Human 1: [yes] [yes] . _i've_ been _to_ _tokyo_ [as] well . _it's_ [so] nice ! 
B|9| Human 2: _i'm_ programmed with world knowledge , [so] while _i don't_ [live] anywhere , [i] _can_ help [you] understand [the] weather [in] [tokyo] or any other 
A|10| Human 1: oh everything ! [i] went _to_ [an] _onsen_ , [the] fish market , _disney land_ [and] _giant_ robot fighting show haha 
B|11| Human 2: [it] appears [i've] piqued your interest with [the] virtual experiences ! while [onsen] [and] [disney land] [are] indeed exhilarating , [giant] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] [disney] lands [are] all different ! there's _also_ _disney sea_ , which _is_ completely _unique_ ! 
B|13| Human 2: [disney sea] [and] tokyo's bustling city life [are] both [unique] experiences . [the] [onsen] offers a serene retreat with [hot] spring baths 
A|14| Human 1: [i don't] really remember what part [of] town [it] [was] [in] . [it] [was] pretty cool though - [i'm] sure _you can find_ [it] if [you] google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha 
B|15| Human 2: [it's] fascinating [to] think about [the] diversity [of] activities [and] experiences [you can find] [in] [tokyo] . there [is] [also] [the] historical asakusa
