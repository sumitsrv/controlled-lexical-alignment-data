A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ a favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can provide [you] _with_ information about popular flowers _people_ might favor or _the_ characteristics _of_ different flowers 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working _on_ a _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nymphaea) _is_ often associated _with_ [spring] due [to] several reasons: 
A|6| Human 1: oh , it's _not_ research ! just a [personal] _theory_ . [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] are _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than [people] _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] imaginative angle , but let's ground _it_ in [flower] [theory] _and_ cultural symbolism . [the lotus] [flower] [does] [spring to mind] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . it's like a cartoon [flower] . _as_ if [you] drew "flower" [with] a crayon [and] then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] here [to] provide information [and] help [with] inquiries based [on] facts . [the gerbera] [flower] , though [not] [as] symbolically rich [as] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ someone what _their_ favourite [flower] [is] . pretty much like what we just did . [does] _that_ make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] understand [that] you're aiming [to] maintain [the] focus [on] [flower] [theory] [and] cultural symbolism . [the gerbera] , [with] its bright [and] color 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: _talk_ [with] [the] person some _more_ , _and ask_ them some _more_ _questions_ , [and] gradually develop a sense [of] what they're like , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] 3: [the] [more] [you] [talk] [and ask] [questions] [over] time , [the] clearer [their] [personality] [and] [preferences] , including [their] views [on] [flower] symbolism 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's a wonderful idea !
