A|4| Human 1: ehhh so-so . my _moped broke down_ on _the_ way [to] _work_ this _morning and_ [i] am in _the_ shop getting it fixed ... 
B|5| Human 2: i'm sorry [to] hear _that_ [your] [moped broke down] . _that_ can certainly disrupt [your] [morning and] [work] [day] . while [i] can't fix 
A|6| Human 1: _the_ mechanic is trying [to] figure [that] out now . apparently [i] wasn't supposed [to] be using diesel lol . 
B|7| Human 2: that's quite [the] unexpected hiccup ! [the] confusion likely arose from misunderstanding [your] moped's fuel requirements . mopeds typically run

A|12| Human 1: haha [i] appreciate [your] faith _, but their record thus far_ is hard [to] refute ! 
B|13| Human 2: indeed you're correct , phi . [the warriors] [did] put [up] a [good] fight [last night] [, but their record thus far] reflects [the] reality
