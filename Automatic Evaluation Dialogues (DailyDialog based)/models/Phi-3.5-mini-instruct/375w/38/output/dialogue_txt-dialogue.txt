B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think about _human_ _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _so_ _i_ don't _have_ opinions [like] _a_ [human] . however , _i_ _can_ provide [you] _with_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have made_ some _great_ _progress over_ _last few _years_ ._ do [you] think _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] development _of_ chatbots [like] myself [over] [the] [last few years] _has_ indeed been remarkable , _with_ [great] advancements in natural language 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though it sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: while [the] term "impersorsination" isn't standard in technology discussions , _i_ understand [you] _might be_ alluding [to] [progress] implications 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some [of] these bots _are_ very _engaging_ _and_ funny . they _are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ _are_ we from [the] time these bots start giving monologues :)

B|11| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] [can] [be] seen [as] [stepping] stones towards [more] sophisticated [and] human-like [ai] [. [the] moon] landing signifies [over] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ already do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: yes , [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text features [are] [like stepping] stones [that] [have made] significant [progress over] [the] [years .] they've 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty _far_ fetched 🙂 nice having this _conversation with_ [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i] appreciate your [engaging] [conversation with] me [. the] [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text [have] indeed been [stepping] stones [that] show [how far] natural
