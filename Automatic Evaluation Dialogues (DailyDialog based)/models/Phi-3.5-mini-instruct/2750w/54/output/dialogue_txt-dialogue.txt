A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello there , how is _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _great_ . _i_ _just_ _won_ _a_ _pingpong game_ . what _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i don't_ have feelings or _physical_ experiences _, but i'm_ here _and_ ready _to_ assist [you] ! congratulations on _your_ [pingpong game] 
A|4| Human 1: no , very rarely . _it's_ kind of _amazing_ _that i_ _won_ [, but i'm] still _taking_ credit _for_ [it] . 
B|5| Human 2: [it's] [great] [that] [you] [won] ! while [i] can't play [pingpong] or feel [amazing] [about] games , [it's] always nice _to_ 
A|6| Human 1: haha thank _you ,_ [i] guess _i'm just_ _a_ natural . what's [your] favourite [game] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm just] [your] friendly ai [, but] if [i] had [a] preference [for] games [that i] could simulate , you'd probably find _me_ [taking] on 
A|8| Human 1: what's racquetball _like_ ? _from_ context clues , [i'm] guessing [that] [it] _involves hitting_ [a] _ball with_ [a] _racquet_ 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm just] [like] you—pure logic _and_ programmed responses . if [pingpong] [involves hitting] [ball with] [racquet] , that's [about] 
A|10| Human 1: wow ! [a] cage _match_ ! does [it] _get physical_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm just] [your] friendly ai [with] nothing [but] code [for] physicality . [but] [taking] cues [from] [you ,] [that] [match] _sounds_ [like] [a] clash 
A|12| Human 1: [that] [sounds] fun . [i] think of _tennis_ itself as being _really_ athletic [and] tiring , so [i don't] think [it's] [a] sport [for] [me] , _though_ ! 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [for] [you ,] [and] [though] [i don't] tire or [get physical] [with] [tennis] strings , [your] analogy [really] brings [it] _to_ 
A|14| Human 1: what [a] good idea , i'd love [to] !
