Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I am Phi, an artificial intelligence, so I don't run marathons or have time improvements in the human sense. However, humans
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	As Phi, I am not a human and thus do not participate in sporting events or any physical activities. I exist to assist you through
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	It's interesting you mention Spartan race challenges; I am Phi, and as an artificial intelligence, I do not engage in any
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and while I don't race monkey bars or walls or any obstacles myself, I can certainly assist you in
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I'm Phi and not capable of sign-ups for events but I can help you with the process. 
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	Great! Here's a basic training plan you can follow for the Spartan race-like workout leading up to February:
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Here's a 12-week training plan with sessions for technique workout and obstacle practice. It is designed keeping the February Spartan
