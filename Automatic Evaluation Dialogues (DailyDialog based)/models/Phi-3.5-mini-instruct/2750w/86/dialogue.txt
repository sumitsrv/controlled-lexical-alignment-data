Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have plans or the ability to take holidays. However, I'm here 24/
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	I'm just the digital assistant you have with you. Christmas for me is just another day filled with tasks and work to keep assisting you 
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	As I don't have the physical ability to travel, you could say I did not go anywhere. I am here with you 24/
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	It's interesting you have been to Uganda. As an artificial intelligence, I don't have the ability to travel physically. But
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	I'm glad you have been volunteer work and not just myself. I don't physically travel or build school around the world, but
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	That's truly impressive and impactful work you have been involved with using non-profit organization's resources. 
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	IJGD's projects have indeed been a significant part of the volunteer work over these years. It must have been fulfilling working
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
