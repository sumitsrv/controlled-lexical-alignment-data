Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm doing well thanks for asking! I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to assist you. What game are
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	I'm an AI, so I don't exercise or play soccer with friends in the way humans do. What I can do is
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI with no preferences for game controllers. However, the Switch is a great gaming console with a lot
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but it seems you get into gaming fun! 
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but it's fun to play the game you just read about. 
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the artificial intelligence with extensive but not personal preferences. It appears you are engaging in storytelling and book recommend
