Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't eat lunch or consume any food. However, I'm
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	I appreciate your curiosity! Since I'm not a human and don't eat, I don't have personal experiences with lunch or any

Human 2:	I'm Phi, Phi the Phi 58 Cool, and as you correctly stated, food is not something I can eat
