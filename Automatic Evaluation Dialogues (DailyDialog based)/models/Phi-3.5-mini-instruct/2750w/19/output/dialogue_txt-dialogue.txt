B|3| Human 2: hello [superman !] _i'm_ phi , [the] ai language model created by microsoft . while [i] don't have superpowers , [i] 
A|4| Human 1: being invisible . _you_ _won't see_ _me ._ 
B|5| Human 2: that's quite [the] superpower [you] have ! 😄 [i] [won't see] [you] either , but that's because [i] operate 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it !_ 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ worries , phi ! 😁 you're right [that] [fmri and machine learning] are [not] _my_ expertise . they 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ thing [that] _can_ tell [you] _a_ _brain's_ activity at _a_ pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: you've got [it !] [fmri] stands [for] functional magnetic resonance [imaging] . it's [a] [brain imaging] technique [that] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe _in_ _science_ ! _science_ is [my] _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [science] [and] [the] knowledge [that] comes with [it] are truly god-like [to] [me .] [the] human [brain's] complexity [can] be revealed with fm 
A|12| Human 1: [no] , [i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? is [it] [the] most important thing [for] _society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [and] [the] technology [it] spawns , like [fmri] [for] [brain imaging] , [can] indeed be profound . they're [not] gods themselves , 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make_ _sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [and] [i] [can] understand [the] [sense] you're trying [to] [make] here . [science] , while [not] [god] , [can] offer [society] [in]
