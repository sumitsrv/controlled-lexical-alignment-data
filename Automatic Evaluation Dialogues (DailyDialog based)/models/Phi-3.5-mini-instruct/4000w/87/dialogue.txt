Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI digital assistant. I don't have personal activities, but I'm here to help you with any
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and reading isn't something I do, but I can help you find the book you are enjoying, or suggest
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and while I don't sleep like you do, I have lots of information that can help! For better sleep tips
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but good sleep tips are definitely within my capabilities! Zero to One by Peter Thiel is a great read that combines
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	Zero to One focuses on innovation and creating unique markets that have little competition. Thiel's principles are about the foundation for startups
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	Absolutely, being contrarian in research and sleep also have their benefits: 
Human 1:	 yup!
