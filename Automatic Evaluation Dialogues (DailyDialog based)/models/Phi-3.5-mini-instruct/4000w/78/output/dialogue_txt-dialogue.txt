A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: [hi] there . when did _you_ first realize _you_ wanted _to be a pastry chef_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: who _said_ _i_ want [to be a pastry chef] ?... haha 
B|3| Human 2: _no_ one [said] it; it's your own desire ! whoever feels [a] passion _for_ baking , decorating , _and_ creating delightful [pastry] 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ _actually_ [a] _cake_ [chef] , so _not_ far off ! creepy _how_ _good_ _that_ _guess_ _was_ .... are [you] _psychic_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] [not] psychic—i'm [actually] powered by artificial intelligence _and_ designed [to] [guess] based on data you've provided . [cake] 
A|6| Human 1: haha you're _too_ _funny_ ! perhaps instead _of_ mind-reading powers , [you] _have_ _the_ ability [to] _feel_ _the_ _auras_ _of_ foods _that_ _have_ come [and] gone ... 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [psychic] [and] don't [feel] [auras] either , but [that] [was] [good] fun with [you] ! 🎂 [i] [actually] 
A|8| Human 1: chocolate [cake] + _vanilla_ icing is _the_ _all_ time best ! [and] [i] _have_ _the_ authority [to] say [that] _! _how about_ you ? have_ [a] favorite ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [all] [about] [the] [vanilla] [and] [a] [good] dusting [of] cinnamon fun ! 🍰 [how about you ? have] 
A|10| Human 1: [no] shame _in_ [that] ! best part is [you] _can_ claim [you] are eating _vegetables_ as [you] enjoy it ! what do [you] do [for] _work_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [a] phocos-sourced language model powered by microsoft . [and] [about] [vegetables] , [that] [can] indeed [be] 
A|12| Human 1: woah ! _very_ cool ! what style _of dance_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [all] [in] [for] [the] dance-off [too] [! how about] [a] [funny] [vegetables] pun [to] mix into [that] [good] vibe ? 
A|14| Human 1: oh _wow_ ! sounds like _a very dynamic kind of_ _work_ _which_ is _nice_ . [i] make [a] lot [of] [the] same cakes , day [in] day out . 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [the] [cake] [that] never crumbles [in] [work] [for] [a very dynamic kind [of] dance] [which] [wow] [you] [nice] day-to-day
