Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't experience days, but I'm fully operational and ready to assist you
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear about your moped and the inconvenience this morning has caused you. While I can't fix mopeds
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	Yes, that's a moped-specific issue! The engines and mechanics work differently for mopeds compared to diesel vehicles. It
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI, so I don't drive mopeds or diesel vehicles, and here you are now helping
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and don't drive mopeds or diesel engines. However, here you are now! Regarding the Warriors game
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	That's the way you should refute their record; your points don't seem far behind 😄 Did they outscore last
