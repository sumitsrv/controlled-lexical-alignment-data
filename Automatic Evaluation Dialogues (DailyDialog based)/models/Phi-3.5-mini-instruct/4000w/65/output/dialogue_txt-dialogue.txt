A|4| Human 1: ehhh so-so . my _moped_ broke down on _the way_ [to] _work_ _this morning_ [and] [i] am in _the_ shop getting _it_ fixed ... 
B|5| Human 2: i'm sorry [to] hear about [your] [moped] [and] [the] inconvenience [this morning] has caused _you_ . while [i] can't fix mopeds 
A|6| Human 1: [the] mechanic is trying [to] figure that out _now_ . apparently [i] wasn't supposed [to] be using _diesel_ lol . 
B|7| Human 2: yes , that's a moped-specific issue ! [the] engines [and] mechanics [work] differently for mopeds compared [to] [diesel] vehicles . [it] 
A|8| Human 1: okay sounds good . would [you] be able [to] pick me up by _the way_ , if _they_ [don't] finish up _here_ in time ? _did_ [you] _drive_ [to] [work] today ? 
B|9| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] ai , so [i] [don't] [drive] mopeds or [diesel] vehicles , [and] [here] [you] are [now] helping 
A|10| Human 1: that _should_ be fine [i] think . _did_ [you] catch _the warriors game_ _last_ night btw ? 
B|11| Human 2: i'm phi [and] [don't] [drive] mopeds or [diesel] engines . however , [here] [you] are [now] ! regarding [the warriors game] 
A|12| Human 1: haha [i] appreciate [your] faith [, but] _their_ record thus _far_ is hard [to] _refute_ ! 
B|13| Human 2: that's [the way] [you] [should] [refute] [their] record; [your] points [don't] seem [far] behind 😄 [did] [they] outscore [last]
