A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! what _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , [the] ai language model here _to_ assist [you] ! unlike [superman] , _my_ powers are based _on_ processing information _and_ generating 
A|4| Human 1: being invisible . [you] _won't see_ _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: you're right , [i] [won't see] [you] [the] way [superman] _can_ , but _i'm_ "invisible" _in_ _a_ different _sense_ . 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an expert [on] _that ._ sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: absolutely [not] _a_ problem _at_ all ! 😊 [fmri and machine learning] algorithms are [the] superpowers of [this] digital real 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain_ imaging thing _that_ [can] _tell you_ [a] brain's _activity_ [at] [a] _pretty_ _high_ resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: that's correct ! [fmri] [can] show [brain] [activity] [and] [tell you] [pretty] detailed [about] [that .] [the] [machine learning] side helps [me] understand language [and] generate 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science_ is [my] god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [and machine learning] truly [can] be god-like [in] [the] _sense_ [that] they help us understand [and] create . [the] combination of [fmri] , [for] [high] 
A|12| Human 1: no , [i'm] bad [at] [science] . what [can] [science] do ? is it [the] most important thing _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [and] [the] technologies [that] arise from scientific discovery , including [fmri] , [machine learning] algorithms , [and] others , [can] profoundly impact [society] . 
A|14| Human 1: does it _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: yes , that's [a] fair understanding . [science] [and] [the] resulting technologies [can] indeed [make sense] [for society] , as they [can] lead [to] advancements
