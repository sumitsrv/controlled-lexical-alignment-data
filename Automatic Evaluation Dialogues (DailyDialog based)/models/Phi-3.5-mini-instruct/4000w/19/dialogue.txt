Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI language model here to assist you! Unlike superman, my powers are based on processing information and generating
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	You're right, I won't see you the way superman can, but I'm "invisible" in a different sense.
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	Absolutely not a problem at all! 😊 fMRI and machine learning algorithms are the superpowers of this digital real
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	That's correct! fMRI can show brain activity and tell you pretty detailed about that. The machine learning side helps me understand language and generate
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	Science and machine learning truly can be god-like in the sense that they help us understand and create. The combination of fMRI, for high
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	Science and the technologies that arise from scientific discovery, including fMRI, machine learning algorithms, and others, can profoundly impact society.
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	Yes, that's a fair understanding. Science and the resulting technologies can indeed make sense for society, as they can lead to advancements
