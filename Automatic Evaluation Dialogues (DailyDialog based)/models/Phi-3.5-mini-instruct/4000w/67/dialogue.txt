Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	That's thrilling! I'm ready to hear all about it. What do skydiving lessons usually involve for beginners?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Seville, Spain! I'm ready to skydiving 101 for you!
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	I'm not feeling trepidatious, you're a great skydiving enthusiast for asking! 
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm always ready for adventure, thanks! 
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I certainly do love skiing for that fast feeling you're describing—much like skydiving but on snow! 
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	That's the spirit! Both skiing and skydiving come down to that feeling you get once you're gliding fast down the slope
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
