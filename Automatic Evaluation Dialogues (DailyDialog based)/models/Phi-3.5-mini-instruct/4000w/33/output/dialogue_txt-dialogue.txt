A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to_ _make_ _croissants ._ 
B|3| Human 2: making [croissants] can be quite _a_ rewarding experience . [it's] _a_ process _that_ involves creating laminated dough _and_ requires patience 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far _, but_ they haven't been flakey enough . _i'm_ trying _to_ figure out why . _what_ kind of _cookies_ _have you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi _, and_ [cookies] aren't within my capabilities [, but] _i_ can certainly assist [you] _with_ croissant flakiness ! it' 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] let's [have you] outperform _me_ in [croissants] ! here's [what] [you] might consider: 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] good _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try next time . would [you] say _you have_ [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] [that] [sweet tooth] [idea] isn't for [croissants .] [it's great] [you have] interests in [cookies] ! 
A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ ! [but] yeah , [me] too , [i] think i'd _eat_ _pastries_ _all the_ time if [i] _could_ get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [eat] [cookies] [the] traditional way [, but] [that] [thought] does [make] [them] [all the] more intriguing [to] [people] like [you] [with] [sweet] teeth . 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort of stuff _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] _fat substitute_ [, and] _caused_ [all] sorts of crazy _stomach upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [the] [idea] [that] [pastries] [could] [have] [caused] [stomach upsets] [with] [fat substitute] marketing [was] indeed something [to] be mind 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
