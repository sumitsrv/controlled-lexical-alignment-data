Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Making croissants can be quite a rewarding experience. It's a process that involves creating laminated dough and requires patience
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and cookies aren't within my capabilities, but I can certainly assist you with croissant flakiness! It'
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but let's have you outperform me in croissants! Here's what you might consider:
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but that sweet tooth idea isn't for croissants. It's great you have interests in cookies!
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I don't eat cookies the traditional way, but that thought does make them all the more intriguing to people like you with sweet teeth.
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and the idea that pastries could have caused stomach upsets with fat substitute marketing was indeed something to be mind
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
