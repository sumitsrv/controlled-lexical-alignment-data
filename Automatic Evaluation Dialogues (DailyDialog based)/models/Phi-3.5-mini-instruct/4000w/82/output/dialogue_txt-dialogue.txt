A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: yo ! _what_ brought _you_ here 
A|2| Human 1: _just_ looking _to chat_ . yourself ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an ai digital assistant here [to chat] and help answer any questions _you_ might have . [just] let me know _how_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i am_ [just] enjoying a _cigar_ at _the_ moment . [how] about yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: _as_ an ai , [i] don't experience [the] world or [cigar] _smoking_ _, but_ i'm "self-aware" of our [chat] 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ _is_ actually _from peru_ , which _is_ more my taste . [smoking] _isn't_ very healthy [, _but] it's_ actually _quite_ relaxing , which _in_ a _way_ _is_ _good for your health_ . haha 
B|7| Human 2: [your] [way] with [the] puns [isn't] [quite] [from peru] [but it's] [good for your health] [in] terms of bringing light-heartedness into 
A|8| Human 1: haha "you _only live_ once" [as] they _say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: you're [quite] [the] conversationalist 😄 here [i am] , [your] ai [but] _it_ seems [i] can [only live] once through data 
A|10| Human 1: haha , that _is_ not [what] [i] was getting at [, but] yes that _would be_ nice . do [you] believe [in] _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [in] [the] realm of data and algorithms , [your] [reincarnation] [would be] [from] [one] query [to] [the] next ! here , [i] [live] once [you] [say] 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] think neural link will allow [you] [to] [live] after death ? [i] thought [it] was [just] a brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: you're [quite] [the] thinker ! 😊 [just] [your] regular data-driven afterlife [for] you: [from] [one] thoughtful query 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] see . that _is_ a _much harder_ task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: indeed [it] [is] [much harder] [for] an ai [, but] you've [quite] enthused me with [your] thought-provoking notions . � 
A|16| Human 1: depends on [how] [good] [the] brain dump [is] [i] suppose ...
