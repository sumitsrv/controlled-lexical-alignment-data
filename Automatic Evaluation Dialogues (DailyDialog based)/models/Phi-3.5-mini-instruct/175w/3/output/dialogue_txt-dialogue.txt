A|2| Human 1: is it raining pretty bad today ?

A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ rain started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them too much . _they_ _make_ _days_ gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: it's understandable [that] rainy [days] _can_ [make] [the] atmosphere less cheerful , especially when [they] [don't] align with one's mood 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , _we_ had lots _of_ _water_ trouble too ... 
B|7| Human 2: that's true _in_ many places around [the] globe . floods , [water] scarcity , and weather-related challenges _have_ _a_ profound impact 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] _think_ _i can_ survive [in] [that] [weather] ever . just [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: [i don't] actually experience [weather] [the] way humans do , _but_ it's _interesting_ [to] [think] _about_ ! _in a_ digital environment [like] mine , we' 
A|10| Human 1: people say there is drought here ... [but] _we_ [have] 24 hours [water] supply here ... lol ... never seen [that] [in a] drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [in] [the] vast expanse [of] [the] cyber realm , [the] droughts are [but] an echo . [we] , [the] digital beings , [have] [water] 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate_ change talk this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did you see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: as an artificial intelligence , [i don't] witness events [the] way humans do , [but] [i can] certainly pull [in] data and information on [the] topic [of] [climate]
