A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _and_ _i_ don't [think] [like] humans . however , _i_ _can_ tell [you] [about] human- 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ _some_ great _progress_ over last few _years_ . do [you] [think] _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] development _of_ human-like chatbots [like] me _has_ indeed [made] significant [progress] in recent [years] , _and_ _this_ _has_ both positive _and_ negative aspects: 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ understand [the] playfulness in your question ! _as_ for impersonation , _it can_ [have] varied implications: 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! _some of_ these bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny _. they_ _are_ now _good_ at even _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how far _are_ we from [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: indeed , [sarcasm] [and] other complex emotional expressions [are] [some of] [the] areas [that] artificial intelligence _is_ progressing fast in . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] [it can] take many different forms [as] _a_ product . [the] research implication [is] also huge ! [it] will signify how [ai] research [has] progressed so far [and] better place _to_ tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like stepping_ on _the moon_ 🙂 [i] _might_ be _overselling_ [it] _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: no [overselling] [here] , [and] your analogy [is] quite apt ! [the] [progress] in [ai] [has] indeed been [like stepping] onto [the moon] - monument 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] conversational capabilities [are] quite advanced [already] [. they] [can] understand context [to] [a] [good] extent , which [might] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having [this] conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i] appreciate your humor ! 😄 while [i] don't possess human-like wit , i'm [here] [to] assist [and] engage
