A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think about human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _and_ _i_ don't _have_ opinions . however , _i_ _can_ share _some_ insights 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ [some] great _progress_ over last few years . do _you_ think _the_ positives _outweigh_ _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the] field _of_ chatbots _has_ indeed [made] significant strides , offering numerous benefits _that_ _can_ [outweigh] _some of_ [the] potential [negatives] , especially when 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: ha ! well , impersion or blending _of_ [the] real _and_ virtual through _ai_ _might_ not _be_ fully realized yet , but indeed , it's 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some of] these bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny . _they_ _are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they] [have] certainly become quite sophisticated in understanding [and] generating natural language _. the_ technology behind them _is_ continually improving , [and] _with_ advanc 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think it [can] take _many_ different forms as _a_ product [. the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! it will signify how _ai research_ [has] progressed so far [and] better place _to_ tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like_ _stepping on the moon_ 🙂 [i] [might] [be] overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [stepping on the moon] [is] certainly [a] monumental achievement , [and] [the] [progress] in [ai research] holds [the] promise [of] [many] [more] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ already do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: indeed , [ai] [is] rapidly advancing . [from] [auto-suggestions] [on] our smartphones [to] complex natural language processing , [ai] [has] [made] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: i'm glad [you] enjoyed our exchange . ai's capabilities [are] growing every day , making interactions [like] [this] increasingly seamless [and] natural
