A|2| Human 1: _i am_ [the] _superman_ ! what about _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , _an_ ai designed _to_ assist [you] ! while [i] don't have superpowers like [superman] , [i] _can_ certainly 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: that's _an_ amusing thought ! [i] don't have [the] ability _to_ [see] or become [invisible] , but _i'm_ here , ready _to_ help 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust fmri _and machine learning_ [to] do this . _i am_ not [an] expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ worries ! it's just _a_ playful thought . rest assured , [i am] equipped with advanced algorithms [and machine learning] capabilities [that] enable [me] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ thing [that] [can] tell [you] [a] brain's activity at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: yes , you're correct . functional magnetic resonance [imaging] (fmri) _is_ indeed [a] [brain imaging] technique . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe _in_ _science !_ _science is_ _my_ god ! 
B|11| Human 2: it's great [to] [see] your enthusiasm [for] [science !] indeed , [science] [and] technology , particularly [machine learning] [and] algorithms , serve as powerful tools [to] 
A|12| Human 1: [no] , [i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] _it_ [the] most _important_ thing _for society_ ?
