Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't experience weeks or personal sentiments. However, I'm here
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm here to assist you remotely! While I don't require chilling, I can help make your day easier. Here'

Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?

Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	I must clarify, as Phi the AI, I don't have physical experiences, feelings, or the capacity to carry lotion. However
