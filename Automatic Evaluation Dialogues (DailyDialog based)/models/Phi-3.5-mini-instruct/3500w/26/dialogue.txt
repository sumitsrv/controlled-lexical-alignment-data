Human 1:	 I'm mark. I work in accounting
Human 2:	Hi Mark! I'm Phi, your AI assistant. Accounting sounds interesting. Is there anything accounting-related you'd like
Human 1:	 what does a fish groomer do?
Human 2:	Hello Mark! I'm Phi, your AI assistant. A fish groomer does not work in accounting, but I can help clarify
Human 1:	 interesting. what's type of fish do you take care of?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and accounting does not involve fish grooming. However, you're asking interesting questions! 
Human 1:	 I balance the books and do financial analysis for a medium sized company
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI and while financial analysis does fall under accounting for medium sized companies, fish grooming isn't
Human 1:	 well I actually think about pursuing photography, but it's really hard
Human 2:	I'm Phi and it's interesting you pursued photography but accounting was the path for financial analysis. 
Human 1:	 thank you Tom!! I'm starting by trying to sell my pictures online
Human 2:	I'm Phi and it's really interesting you pursued photography but for the analysis of financial pictures online, 
Human 1:	 Thanks! Bye
