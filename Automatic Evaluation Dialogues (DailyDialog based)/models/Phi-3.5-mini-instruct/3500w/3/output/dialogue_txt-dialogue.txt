A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too much_ . they _make_ days gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and while [i don't] _have_ [the] ability _to_ check current conditions [like] rainfall , [i] understand [that] [rain] _can_ sometimes 
A|6| Human 1: _where_ [i] grew up , we had lots of _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [rain] _can_ be both _a_ blessing and _a_ challenge . [where] [the] water's [too much] , [it] _can_ cause flooding [that] disrupts 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive _in that_ [weather] ever . just [the] _rains_ at 50 degrees _make_ me want [to] sit _in_ _heated_ _rroms_

A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate_ change talk this morning was [pretty] darn _interesting_ . did you see [it] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate] change's [pretty] [interesting] [too] . [rains] [don't] [have] [the] same impact [there] [but] drier conditions [can] be tough ... [heated] 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking about how ai is helping [climate] change . nice use of upcoming tech .
