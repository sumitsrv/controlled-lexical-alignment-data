A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . _you_ _won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: you've got [the] spirit ! 😄 while [i] [won't see] [you] [invisible] _, i'm_ right here , ready _to_ help 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would _rather_ trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ it ! 
B|7| Human 2: _no_ [fmri and machine learning] involved [for] [this] chat – that's [about] [the] technology [you] [see] [rather] than us engaging . 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain imaging_ thing _that_ _can_ tell [you] _a_ brain's activity at _a_ pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: you're correct [that] [fmri and machine learning] are [not] directly involved _in_ [this] chat . [the brain imaging] you're referring [to] _is_ _most_ 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] _does_ indeed encompass [the brain imaging] you're mentioning [and machine learning] [can] be [a] powerful tool within [this] domain [for] data analysis . 
A|12| Human 1: [no] [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] [most] important thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science is] [the] systematic enterprise [that] builds [and] organizes knowledge [in] [the] form of testable explanations [and] predictions [about] [the] universe . it's
