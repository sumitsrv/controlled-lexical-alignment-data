Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.

Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.

Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and you don't have to worry about pastries that caused stomach upsets. Now, when it comes to
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
