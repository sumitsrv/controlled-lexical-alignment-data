Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	It's pretty cool you have been there 24/7 haha I might just try out some amateur tournament myself and give the live watch
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I might just consider that the beginning of competitive training and not pass out. It's important to have fun but also stay safe and healthy
