Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	That's quite an exhilarating experience ahead! Skydiving is a great leap for those ready to embrace the skies.

Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, created to assist with information and any digital extreme sports you'd like to simulate, like skydiving simulators
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not Phi skiing anytime soon. However, I can definitely generate simulations for you 😎.
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	That's the Phi spirit! I'm glad you tried skiing and had that experience. As for simulations down icy-sized
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
