A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: [hi] there . when did _you_ first realize _you_ wanted _to be a pastry chef_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _who_ _said_ _i_ _want [to_ be a pastry chef] ?... haha 
B|3| Human 2: _no_ one [said] it—you shared _it_ with me ! sometimes people just [want to] share their dreams _and_ ambitions . [who] knows , maybe one _day_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ _actually a_ _cake chef_ , so _not_ far off ! creepy _how_ _good_ _that_ _guess_ _was_ .... _are_ [you] _psychic_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [psychic] , [i] [guess] [you] could _say that_ _the_ [cake chef] [was] [actually a] [good] haiku . [cake] chefs craft del 
A|6| Human 1: haha you're too funny ! perhaps instead _of_ mind-reading powers , [you] _have the ability to feel_ [the] auras _of_ _foods that_ _have_ _come_ [and] gone ... 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [a] [chef] [and] don't [have the ability to feel] [foods that] [you] describe , but [i] [guess] humor _is_ one way [to] b 
A|8| Human 1: chocolate [cake] + vanilla icing [is] [the] _all_ time best _! and_ [i] [have the] authority [to] [say that] ! _how about_ [you] ? [have] [a] favorite ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [all] [about] [the] fun [and] frosting [that] [you] [come] up with [! and] [a] [good] cake-slinging joke will [have] 
A|10| Human 1: [no] shame in [that] ! best _part_ [is] [you] can claim [you] _are_ _eating_ vegetables as [you] enjoy [it] ! what do [you] do _for work_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [a] chatgpt , [not] [eating] [for work] but cake-slinging words [are] [part] [and] parcel [of] my programming 
A|12| Human 1: woah ! very cool ! what style [of] _dance_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] can't [dance] [the] traditional way , but [i'm] [good] at [a] cool-cat [cake] haiku [that] never fails [to] stir up some 
A|14| Human 1: oh wow ! sounds like [a] very dynamic kind [of] [work] which [is] nice . [i] make [a] lot [of] [the] same cakes , [day] in [day] out . 
B|15| Human 2: [how about] [that] [for] [a] [work] [day] cake-haiku:
