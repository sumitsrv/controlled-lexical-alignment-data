A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [have] _personal_ likes or dislikes _as_ _i_ am an ai , but _i_ can tell [you] _that_ many _people_ [have] [favourite] 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ _working on a_ _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ [a] potent symbol in various philosophical , religious _, and_ cultural contexts , which could [spring to mind] when [working on a] 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ [a] [personal] _theory_ . [i] think [that] [flower] _preferences are_ more _revealing_ _of_ _personality_ than [people] _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [that] [theory] ! in [the] human realm , [preferences are] indeed [revealing] . while [i'm] [not] capable [of] [personal] likes , _it_ 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] _if_ [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] _crayon_ _and then_ [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's like] [you] [are] painting _with the_ language [and then] [i] [have] [to] [appreciate] [it] [that] way ! [the gerbera] [flower] [does] [not] [have] [personal] prefer 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ _what_ their [favourite] [flower is] . pretty much [like] _what_ we _just_ _did_ . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] playing _with the_ _idea_ [that] [if] [i] were [someone] [with] [personal] [preferences] [like] [you] [did] initially , [gerbera] [flower] , [crayon] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: _talk_ [with the] person _some_ more [, and] ask _them_ _some_ more questions [, and] gradually _develop_ [a] sense [of] _what_ they're [like] , _over the_ course [of] maybe two [to] five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [just] imagining [what] [it's like] [to] [develop] [preferences] [and] [have] [them] reveal [some] [personality] [over the] [years] [with] [people] [you] [talk] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful [idea] !
