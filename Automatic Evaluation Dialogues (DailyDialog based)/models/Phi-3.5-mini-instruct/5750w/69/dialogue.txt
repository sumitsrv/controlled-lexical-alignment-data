Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I was not party last week as I am Phi, your AI assistant. However, I'm here for you! How can I assist
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	Haha, I like your spirit! However, I am a software and therefore don't eat or have bunches like you might say for Tur
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	I'm glad you found it funny! I may not eat food or gather like a group of turkeys, but I'm here 
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	No cooking from outside either, I was a bit surprised you thought of me like that! But it's funny your way 
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Haha, your humor is always a fun cook-up with the turkey talk, even if it was not from outside! ���
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Thanksgiving with chicken always gets a big oven party cooked up fun games 🎉 How did you roll last Turkey Day
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Pictionary and office tennis are both great games that work well with any party theme, funny turkey or not! Did you have a favorite moment
