Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?

Human 2:	You've certainly crafted a superman metaphor 😊! While I won't see you the way invisible cloaks
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	You've got the charm, Phi! 🌟 I'm not fMRI expert, machine learning is about supervised
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	You're correct that fMRI and machine learning can reveal brain activity, but they can't see the invisible. 
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	I'm Phi and I can tell you that fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) helps scientists see
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and Science can do wonders for society. 
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	I see what you're trying to say. fMRI can indeed make sense for society because it is a powerful imaging technique that allows research
