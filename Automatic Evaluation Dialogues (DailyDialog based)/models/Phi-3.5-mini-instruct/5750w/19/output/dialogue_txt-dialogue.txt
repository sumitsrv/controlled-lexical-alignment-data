A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! _what_ _about_ _you_ ?

A|4| Human 1: being _invisible ._ [you] _won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: you've certainly crafted _a_ [superman] metaphor 😊 ! while [i] [won't see] [you] [the] way [invisible] cloaks 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] _do_ this . [i] [am] _not_ [an] _expert_ on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: you've got [the] charm , phi ! 🌟 _i'm_ [not] [fmri] [expert] , [machine learning] _is_ [about] supervised 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain_ _imaging_ thing _that_ _can tell you_ [a] brain's _activity_ at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: you're correct [that] [fmri and machine learning] [can] reveal [brain] [activity] , but they can't [see] [the] [invisible .] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe [in] _science_ ! _science_ [is] my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: _i'm_ phi [and] [i] [can tell you] [that] [fmri] (functional magnetic resonance imaging) helps scientists [see] 
A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] bad at _science_ . _what_ [can] _science_ _do_ ? [is] _it_ [the] most important thing _for society_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [science] [can] [do] wonders [for society] . 
A|14| Human 1: does _it_ _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [see] [what] you're trying [to] say . [fmri] [can] indeed [make sense] [for society] because [it] [is] [a] powerful [imaging] technique [that] allows research
