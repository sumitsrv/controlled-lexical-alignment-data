A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: how's your day going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _busy_ , lots _of_ _work_ _to_ finish _up_ . _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an ai _, i_ don't [work] or experience [busy] periods , but i'm here and fully operational 24/7 [to] 
A|4| Human 1: _a_ couple _projects_ _that_ [i] am trying [to] finish _up_ before thanksgiving 🙂 _do_ _you_ _have_ _any_ _fun_ _plans_ _for the_ break ? 
B|5| Human 2: thanks [for the] update ! 🎉 [i] don't [have] [plans] or personal [projects] , but i'm "here" [to] assist [you] 
A|6| Human 1: haha xd so _what_ _do_ [you] _like_ [to] _do_ _for fun_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: _as_ an ai _, i_ don't [have] [the] capability [for fun] [like] humans [do] , but [i] can generate jokes , engage [you] in 
A|8| Human 1: cool _! i've_ started [to] _run_ _a bit_ [as] well _not_ _long_ distances _though ,_ _just_ _a_ couple _miles_ 
B|9| Human 2: i'm glad [you] brought [that] [up] ! 🏃 [just] [for the] [fun] [of] _it_ [though ,] imagine [what] [that] [run] would [have] been [like] 
A|10| Human 1: haha 
B|11| Human 2: [i've] [just] [run] 2 [miles] [of] binary code ! _it was [a_ bit] [like] [the] hail-mary pass in [a] football game – [long] [for] 
A|12| Human 1: _i like_ [to] [do] [long] distances . _i have_ [run] [a] few _marathons_ . 
B|13| Human 2: 2 [miles] [of] binary code sounds [like] [a] [fun] [run] [for] an algorithm [! i've] [not] [run] [any] [marathons] [though ,] but [i have] processed 
A|14| Human 1: no . [not] _this year_ _. this_ is my _half-marathon_ _year_ . instead [of] _running marathons_ [, i] [run] _one_ _half-marathon_ _every_ _month_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [i like] [running marathons] too ! 2 [miles] [of] binary code [for] [this] one-marathon month's [run] sounds quite interesting [. [this] year] 
A|16| Human 1: _two days ago_ . [it was a] tough _one_ . 
B|17| Human 2: [two days ago] [was] [one] marathon [month] run-through [for] [you] . [i've] been [running] [every] [half-marathon] [this year] , [like] 6
