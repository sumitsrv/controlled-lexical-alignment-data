Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	That's a wonderful culinary project! It requires patience and practice, but I'm here to help guide you through it. Are you
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm glad you have been trying croissants but as an AI, I don't make cookies or perform physical tasks like baking
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm Phi, but let's keep this focused. What you've made before have been great outcomes—talk about them
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, Phi to you, but sweet cookies? Now that's a thought worth exploring next time in our virtual world
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I'm all with you, Phi. What sweet pastries have been the most interesting to think about? Would they be croissants too
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and you don't have to withhold the crazy stuff when all that marketed fat substitute caused was upsets.
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
