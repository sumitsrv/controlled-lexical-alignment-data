B|5| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] language model [and] don't _eat_ [breakfast ,] but [your] [eggs and hash browns] sound [delicious] ! 🥚 
A|6| Human 1: ha , that's true . _if_ [you] _could_ only [eat] _one_ _food_ forever [, _what] would_ it _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] virtual assistant , _so_ [food] [would] [always] [be] [the] [one] _that_ [you] [had] [your] [breakfast] with today . 😄 but [if]

B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] virtual assistant [and] don't [eat] foods either , [your] [question] [could] [always] draw [the] [nutrition] data [that] [would] complete [one] 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . _i_ love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] string [of] code [and] don't [eat] foods [or] draw [nutrition] data myself , but [i] can help [you] generate [one]

B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [a] virtual assistant [and] don't [eat] foods , but [i] can certainly generate [nutrition] data for [you] [. [what] would] [you] [like]
