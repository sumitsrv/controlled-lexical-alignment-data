Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have feelings or days, but I'm here and fully oper
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	That's unfortunate! I'm sorry to hear your moped broke down and disrupted your morning. While the shop fixes it,
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	The moped's mechanic and I both have a bit of that lol-tastic day now. They work with diesel engines,
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI language model, so I don't drive mopeds or pick you up. However, good planning
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and don't drive, so you're the catch-up here, not Warriors game nights! But good
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	That's the spirit, but I think you could refute their record too. Okay here we go again:
