A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can share information about popular favorites . many _people appreciate_ _the_ beauty _and_ fragrance 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ often associated in many cultures _and_ [the] mind's imagery for [a] number _of_ reasons: 
A|6| Human 1: oh , it's _not_ research ! _just_ [a] [personal] theory . [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than [people appreciate] . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [not] [i] . [just] wanted [to] clarify . 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . it's _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then _it_ came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [not] i; [it] seems [like] [you] [are] [the] [personality] [with] [preferences] in [that] previous message . [the gerbera] [flower] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ _someone_ what their favourite [flower is] . pretty much [like] what we [just] did . _does_ [that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [it] [does] [make sense] [that] [you] [are] inquiring about [preferences] [like] [flower] choices . [the gerbera] can indeed reveal 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some_ _more_ , [and] _ask_ them _some_ _more_ _questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] what they're [like] , _over the_ course [of] _maybe_ two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [and] [just] [like] [that] , you're [not] [just] [someone] [with] [some] [preferences] [and] [maybe] [questions] they [ask] [over the] years—but [it] feels [more] [personal] , 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
