Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I can share information about popular favorites. Many people appreciate the beauty and fragrance
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	The lotus flower is often associated in many cultures and the mind's imagery for a number of reasons:
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, not I. Just wanted to clarify. 
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and not I; it seems like you are the personality with preferences in that previous message. The gerbera flower
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and it does make sense that you are inquiring about preferences like flower choices. The gerbera can indeed reveal
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	And just like that, you're not just someone with some preferences and maybe questions they ask over the years—but it feels more personal,
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
