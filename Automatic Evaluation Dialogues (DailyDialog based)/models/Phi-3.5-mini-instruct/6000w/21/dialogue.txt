Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	Terminators movies are well-known for the action-packed endings that often touch upon themes like time's fleeting nature
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	not happy ending but it's bittersweet. the Terminators movies end with time running out for protagonists, like Sarah Connor
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	it's not spoil you want but the ending that haunts. time running out, especially in movies like Terminator 2
Human 1:	 Thanks!
