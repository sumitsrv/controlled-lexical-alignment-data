A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to learn how_ _to_ _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _ah ,_ [croissants] are _a_ classic french pastry known for their flaky texture . [it's great] _that_ you're [trying to learn how] 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done_ _them_ _once or_ twice so far , _but they haven't_ _been_ _flakey enough ._ _i'm_ [trying to] figure _out_ why . what _kind of_ cookies _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad _you have_ _some_ experience [but] [flakey] [croissants] can be quite challenging . _it_ often comes down [to] [how] they've [been] 
A|6| Human 1: [ah ,] good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] [trying] [them] [out] [but they haven't] come [out] [flakey enough .] _it_ [made] _me_ _think_ _you have_ [done] [croissants] [once or] 
A|8| Human 1: _now_ [that] is [a] good idea . i'll give [it] [a] try next time . would [you] say [you have] _a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] more [of] [a sweet tooth] [but] [once] in [a] [great] while _, i_ like [trying] [out] [that] [flakey] croissant you've [been] ch 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people don't ! [but] yeah , [me] too _, i think_ i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ _the_ time if [i] _could_ _get_ away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [the] [kind of] [pastries] [that] [could] [make] [you] [all] day [with] their buttery goodness . [now] [to] [get] [them] [flakey] [, i think] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention _to that_ sort [of] stuff was _when_ <redacted_term> was _being_ marketed as [a] _fat substitute_ , _and_ caused [all] _sorts_ [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [with] [you] on [the] [pastries] [and] [fat substitute] [being] [out] [of] [sorts] . [but] [when] [it] comes [to that] buttery goodness , it' 
A|14| Human 1: [ah ,] maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
