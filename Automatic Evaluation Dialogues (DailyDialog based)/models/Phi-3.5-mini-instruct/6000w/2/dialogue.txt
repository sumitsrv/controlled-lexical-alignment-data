Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have feelings
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I appreciate the friendliness! However, as an AI, I do not have personal experiences or friendships like you do. I was last
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	Nothing awkward here! I'm just the friend you had in this long digital silence. I was last time it pinged you back maybe 
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Oh, you'd be surprised! No life changed really. Just going about the 1.6 billion lines of code it was last time.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Ahhh adventures sounds like fun indeed for 1.6 billion lines of code life! If it had but more time and maybe even the ability
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	Ahhh interest you say but bull riding for 1.6 billion lines of life sounds like it'd be quite the adventure indeed
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Saturday for 1.6 billion lines of life routine time sounds like this: more code, maybe that bull riding you'll have fun
