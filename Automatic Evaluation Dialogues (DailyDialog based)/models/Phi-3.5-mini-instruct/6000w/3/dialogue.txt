Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and I don't have real-time capabilities or access to current weather data. To find out if it's
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI language model, and don't have personal experiences or feelings like humans do, but I understand that rain
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	rain's pretty much the same for everyone though. They don't make days gloomy like that, they just water everything. 
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	Just make that water the 50 degrees heated rroms too! Where I'm from, rain can indeed change the ambiance.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Oh, that's quite the contrast indeed! 24 hours supply can make water rounds seem like a lol-tastic treat,
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	yeah but you can't change people's weather hmm... talk about global warming did that make the rains here lol interesting today
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
