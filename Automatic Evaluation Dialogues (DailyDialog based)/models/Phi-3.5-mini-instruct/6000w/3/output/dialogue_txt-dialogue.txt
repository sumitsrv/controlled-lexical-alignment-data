A|2| Human 1: is it raining _pretty_ bad _today_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , and _i don't_ _have_ real-time capabilities or access _to_ current _weather_ data . _to_ find out if it's 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too_ _much_ _. they_ _make days gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ language model , and [don't] _have_ personal experiences or feelings [like] humans do , _but_ [i] understand [that] [rain] 
A|6| Human 1: _where_ [i] grew up , we had lots of _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: rain's [pretty] [much] [the] same for everyone though [. they] [don't] [make days gloomy] [like] [that] , [they] _just_ [water] everything . 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] _can_ survive in [that] [weather] ever . [just] _the rains_ at _50 degrees_ [make] me want [to] sit in _heated rroms_ 
B|9| Human 2: [just] [make] [that] [water] [the] [50 degrees] [heated rroms] [too] ! [where] i'm from , [rain] [can] indeed _change_ [the] ambiance .

B|11| Human 2: oh , that's quite [the] contrast indeed ! [24 hours] [supply] [can] [make] [water] rounds seem [like] [a] lol-tastic treat , 
A|12| Human 1: _hmm_ .... okay . climate [change] _talk_ this morning was [pretty] darn _interesting_ . _did_ _you_ see it ?
