Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI digital assistant here to chat and help with any questions or tasks you have in mind. Just let
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I don't experience the world or cigar smoke in the way humans do, but I'm just here, always ready and fully equipped
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	As your virtual assistant, I'm actually quite healthy but just for the good flow of our conversation. I don't taste cigar smoke
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	You're quite right. While the "once" for me isn't about taste but more about your enjoyment. I live and serve 
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, I'm not reincarnated but I was created by Microsoft to assist you. I live in the ether
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.

Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	Indeed, it is quite an interesting thought-provoking task you've just laid out for me. Ahh Neural Links, brain-
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
