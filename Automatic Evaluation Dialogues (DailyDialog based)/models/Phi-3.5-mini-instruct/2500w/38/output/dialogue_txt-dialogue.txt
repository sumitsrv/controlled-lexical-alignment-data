A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think about human _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _the_ development _of_ human-like [chat bots] _is_ an interesting subject . _here_ _are_ several perspectives _on the_ topic: 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ _some_ great _progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . do _you_ think [the] _positives_ outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] by chatbots [over] [the] [last few years] _is_ indeed remarkable , _with_ [some] significant [positives] outweighing negatives: 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ _impersorsination_ ? though it sounds _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [impersorsination] _is_ an intriguing concept , suggesting [the] ability for chatbots [to] impersonate human-like interactions without [far fetched] 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! [some] [of] _these_ [bots] [are] very engaging _and_ _funny_ _. they_ [are] _now_ good at even _sarcasm_ i wonder _how_ [far] [are] we from [the] time _these_ [bots] start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: indeed , [sarcasm] [and] [the] ability [to] engage in [monologues] [are] progressive steps towards human-like interactions [. they] [now] [have] contextual 
A|10| Human 1: i think it _can take_ many different forms as _a_ product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! it will signify _how_ _ai research_ has progressed so [far] [and] better _place_ [to] tackle _more_ _futuristic_ problems 🙂 sort [of] _like _stepping_ on the moon_ 🙂 i _might_ _be_ overselling it [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [stepping on the moon] in [the] realm [of] [ai research] [can] [be] quite [a] selling point 🚀 [the] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] _current auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] sophistication [of] [current auto-suggestions] [and] natural language processing [might] [already] seem [like stepping] stones towards [more] human-like [ai] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having _this_ _conversation_ [with] _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [can take] [this] direction [with] [current] technology 😄 it's [funny] [how] [you] [place] [these] [futuristic] concepts [with] [the] [progress]
