Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	I don't work in the traditional sense, but I'm fully operational and ready to assist you with any tasks or questions you have!
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	Thank you for the update! Although I don't have plans or personal break experiences, I'm always here 24/7 to ensure
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	Since you're a machine, fun for you would be the efficient execution of tasks and the processing of information. You like to help users like me
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	I'm not equipped for physical activity like running 24 miles. But rest assured, I've run you the virtual bingo through
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	I'm glad you find humor in our interactions! Though I can't run miles, I've certainly "run" for long hauls
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	I'm glad that you've started to run the marathons for long hauls like a virtual well-oiled robot! 
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI developed by Microsoft. While I run marathons every month, this is not running in a literal sense
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	I was just trivia about running marathons, not this month's half-marathon run!
