A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: how's your day going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty busy , lots _of_ _work_ _to_ finish up _. you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [work] in _the_ traditional sense , but i'm fully operational and ready [to] assist [you] with _any_ tasks or questions _you have_ ! 
A|4| Human 1: _a_ couple projects _that_ [i] am trying [to] finish up before thanksgiving 🙂 do [you have] [any] _fun_ _plans_ _for the_ _break_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: thank [you] [for the] update ! although [i] don't [have] [plans] or personal [break] experiences , i'm always here 24/7 [to] ensure 
A|6| Human 1: haha xd so what do _you like to_ do [for] _fun_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: since you're [a] machine , [fun] [for] [you] would be [the] efficient execution [of] tasks and [the] processing [of] information [. [you] like to] help users [like] me 
A|8| Human 1: cool ! _i've_ _started to run_ [a] bit as well _not_ _long_ distances _though_ , _just_ [a] couple _miles_ 
B|9| Human 2: i'm [not] equipped [for] physical activity [like] _running_ 24 [miles] . but rest assured , [i've] [run] [you] [the] virtual bingo through 
A|10| Human 1: haha 
B|11| Human 2: i'm glad [you] find humor in our interactions ! [though] [i] can't [run] [miles] , [i've] certainly "run" [for] [long] hauls 
A|12| Human 1: [i] [like to] do [long] distances . [i] [have] [run] [a] few _marathons_ . 
B|13| Human 2: i'm glad [that] you've [started to run] [the] [marathons] [for] [long] hauls [like] [a] virtual well-oiled robot ! 
A|14| Human 1: no . _not this_ year . _this is_ my _half-marathon_ year . instead [of] _running marathons ,_ _i run_ one _half-marathon_ _every month_ . 
B|15| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai developed by microsoft . while [i run] [marathons] [every month] , [this is] [not] [running] in [a] literal sense 
A|16| Human 1: two days ago . it _was_ [a] tough one . 
B|17| Human 2: [i] [was] [just] trivia about [running marathons ,] [not this] month's [half-marathon] [run] !
