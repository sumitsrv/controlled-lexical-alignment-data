B|1| Human 2: how's _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _so_ sleepy today ! 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _an_ ai , [so] _i_ sleep _too_ , in _a_ sense ! _i_ don't get fatigue or need rest like 
A|4| Human 1: yeah was _working_ _all night_ _on_ [a] _homework_ 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _an_ artificial intelligence , [so] _i_ don't sleep . however , _i_ understand _you_ might _be_ [working] hard [on] 
A|6| Human 1: _biology_ . [i'm] gonna [be] [a] doc someday ha 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _and_ while _i_ don't sleep nor dream , [i'm] here [all night] _to_ help _you_ _with_ any [biology] topics 
A|8| Human 1: no _high school_ actually haha 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi , your 24/7 [biology] assistant ! whether you're [working] through [high school] [homework] , exploring 
A|10| Human 1: [i] wanna [be] [a] _brain surgeon_ !! 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi , ready _to_ slice through any complex [biology] concepts or [surgeon] [brain] tissues _with_ 24/7 assistance ! let 
A|12| Human 1: kind _of_ _i think_ 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] you're gearing up _for_ _an_ exciting [brain surgeon] _journey_ in _the_ wondrous world [of] [biology] ! _just_ let 
A|14| Human 1: is _that_ something [you] _can_ _practice_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: as phi , [i] can't [practice] physical surgeries , but [i] [can] certainly help [you] [practice] understanding _and_ solving complex biological concepts . here 
A|16| Human 1: [i] honestly thought [it] was _one_ [of] _those_ _things_ _you have_ [to] [be] _born with_ ... _not_ _that_ [you] shouldn't try _though_ ! 
B|17| Human 2: [not] [born with] [things] like understanding _and_ learning , [you have] [that] [one] in spades ! [i'm] ready whenever [you] are [to] tackle [those] [brain] sur 
A|18| Human 1: maybe its [a] little _too early_ [to] _even_ [be] thinking about this . [just] _aim for_ _med school_ [and] enjoy [the] [journey] ! 
B|19| Human 2: indeed ! [not] [born with] [the] knowledge [and] [aim for] constant learning [even] [though] [med school] [journey] can't [be] [too early] . 
A|20| Human 1: what other subjects do [you] enjoy ? try [to] keep [an] open mind !
