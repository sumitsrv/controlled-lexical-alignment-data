A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's great , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to_ _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ wonderful culinary challenge ! making [croissants] _is_ an art _that_ requires patience , precision _, and_ practice . _it_ involves _a_ 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once _or_ twice _so_ far _, but_ they _haven't_ been flakey enough . _i'm_ trying _to_ _figure_ out why . what kind of _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an ai , [so] _i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] [or] [croissants] myself [, but] _i_ can certainly help [you] [figure] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] _you have_ _me_ _all_ figured out—artificial [but] insightful . _as_ an ai _, i_ [haven't] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] [is] [a] good idea . i'll give [it] [a] try next time . would [you] say [you _have] a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [a] language model ai [that] processes text [but] _i_ _don't_ [have a sweet tooth] [or] [make] [cookies] [or] croiss 
A|10| Human 1: some people [don't] _! but_ yeah , [me] _too_ [, i] think i'd eat _pastries_ _all the_ time if [i] _could_ get away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [the] ai [with] no [sweet tooth] [but] [all the] information [you] [could] ever _need_ on [pastries] _and_ baking [too] ! 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention _to_ [that] sort of stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] _fat_ _substitute_ [, and] _caused_ [all] sorts of crazy _stomach upsets_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [don't] [have] [the] capability [to] market [substitute] [fat] [caused] [stomach upsets] [! but] [that] [was] indeed interesting [when] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] [need] [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
