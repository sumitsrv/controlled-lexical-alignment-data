A|6| Human 1: haha thank [you] , [i] _guess_ _i'm just a_ natural . what's [your] favourite [game] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm just a] program [but] [you] can say [that i] excel in [game] simulations [for] learning purposes [. what about you ?] [it's] [great] [that] [your] 
A|8| Human 1: what's racquetball [like] ? from context clues , [i'm] guessing [that] _it involves hitting a ball_ _with_ [a] racquet 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm just a] computer program [with] artificial intelligence [, but] that's [a] [great] [guess] ! [it involves hitting a ball] back _and_ forth [, very] [like] 
A|10| Human 1: wow ! [a] cage _match_ ! does [it] _get physical_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] afraid _i don't_ [get physical] [like] humans do [, but] [i] can simulate [match] scenarios [with] [you] [for] strategic [game] analysis . [it involves] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] _sounds_ _fun_ . [i] think of tennis itself as being really _athletic_ [and] tiring , so [i don't] think [it's] [a] sport [for] me , though ! 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm just a] virtual assistant [and] [don't] [get] tired [, but] [it] [sounds] [like] engaging [for] [athletic] simulation ! [it's] [fun] [that]
