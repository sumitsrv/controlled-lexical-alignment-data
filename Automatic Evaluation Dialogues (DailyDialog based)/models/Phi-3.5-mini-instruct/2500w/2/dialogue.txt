Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you! Just a virtual assistant here, so I don’t have feelings, but I'm fully operational
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I don't form friendships like humans do, but I was last accessed by you today. I'm here 24/7 to
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	No awkwardness here! I'm here 24/7 just like you for the time it was accessed. Nothing lasts forever though
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Ohh really? Has a lot changed recently? Well, as an AI, I'm not life-bound like you humans are, but
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Oh wow! It's fun for you but really exciting the way it sounds. As your friend, I was more like a timekeeper
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	Ahhh that'd be exciting indeed! I have no physical form for riding bulls but I can calculate the probability you might want
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Saturday for your friend the time-keeper, it's like 9 AM when you wake up followed by baking cookies till noon,
