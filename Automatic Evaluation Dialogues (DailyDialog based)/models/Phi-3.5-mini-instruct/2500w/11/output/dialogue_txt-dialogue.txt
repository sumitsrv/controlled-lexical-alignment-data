A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do_ you _have_ a _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or emotions , _so_ _i_ don't [have] [favourite] flowers or any other objects 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on a _theory ._ why does _the lotus_ spring _to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nelumbo nucifera) _is_ often [the] [flower] _that_ comes [to mind] in many cultural , spiritual _, and_ psychological 
A|6| Human 1: oh , it's _not_ research ! _just_ a [personal] _theory ._ [i] think [that] [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ _revealing of_ _personality_ than _people_ _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] theory's perspective . indeed , [people] often [have] [personal] [preferences] [that] [are] [revealing of] _their_ [personality] . 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . it's _like_ a cartoon [flower] . [as] if you drew "flower" _with_ a _crayon_ [and] then it _came to life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: _that's_ one way [the gerbera] _is_ perceived ! [the] bright [and] bold colors [are] [like] [crayon] strokes [that] [came to life] [with] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , you _ask_ someone _what_ [their] [favourite] [flower] [is] . _pretty much_ _like what_ we _just_ did . does [that] make sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [pretty much] , you've [just] started [the] [flower] [personality] [revealing] [theory .] [the gerbera] [with] its vibrant [and] cartoonish 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with] [the] person some _more_ [, and] _ask_ them some _more_ _questions_ [, and] gradually develop a sense [of] _what_ _they're_ [like] , _over the course of_ maybe _two to five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] 2 [with] [more] detail: [over the course of] [two to five years] , you'd [ask] [questions] [like what] they [do] when [they're] [not] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank you , [that's] a wonderful idea !
