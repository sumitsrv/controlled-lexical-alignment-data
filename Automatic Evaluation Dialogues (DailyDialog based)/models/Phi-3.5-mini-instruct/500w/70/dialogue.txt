Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have the capability to create youtube videos or monitor video
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	As an AI language model, I don't use softewares for creating YouTube videos. I'm Powered by Microsoft Phi
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't compose music or create video content myself. However, I can help generate text
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	Thank you for the compliment! While I can't rock out any music myself, I'm here to help you compose any text or bra
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	That's awesome to hear! Although I can't play music or guitar myself, I'm here to assist you with composing lyrics
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	It's impressive that you've taken the time to practice guitar chords! Even though I can't play any instrument, I can
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	Precisely! Just like the chords are essential for rhythm and harmony in music, alphabets lay the foundation for language.
