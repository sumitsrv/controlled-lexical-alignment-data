B|1| Human 2: [hi] , how _are you_ _doing_ ! 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ [doing] well . what [are you] up _to_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an ai language model created _by_ microsoft _. i_ don't have personal activities _, but_ [i'm] here 2 
A|4| Human 1: wow , that's _impressive_ [. i] already gave up on cleaning _emails_ long ago 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad you're finding [impressive] things ! while [i] don't clean [emails] or engage in physical activities _, i_ can certainly help 
A|6| Human 1: yea , _a_ little _bit_ _, but it's_ okay 🙂 what do [you] _enjoy_ [doing] outside _work_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: as an artificial intelligence _, i_ don't [enjoy] activities in _the_ human sense . [but] [i'm] here [to] assist [you] with any information or [work] [you] 
A|8| Human 1: ah cool . _so_ [you] _like_ _action_ _movies_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an ai _, so_ [i] don't _watch_ [movies] or have personal preferences . however _, i_ can discuss [action] 
A|10| Human 1: what happened there ? [i] watched bits _of_ _terminators_ [movies] [but] never _a_ full one 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi ! [i] don't _watch_ [movies] either [, but it's] interesting [to] analyze them . [terminators] [are] often centered 
A|12| Human 1: haha sure . [by] [the] time [, i] get [to] it; [i] will forget [the] details , only knowing _that_ [it's] _touching_ at [the] end 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [the] ai . while [i] don't experience [movies] [, i] can certainly appreciate [that] [touching] endings [are] part 
A|14| Human 1: oh no [, so] [it's] _not happy ending_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [not happy ending] [the] term itself carries [a] [bit] [of] melancholy due [to] [the] loss and sacrifice involved . [but it's] [a] way [to] reflect 
A|16| Human 1: then [i] want [to] [watch] it ! _you didn't spoil much_ 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: indeed , [you didn't spoil much] , phi . [the] layers [of] storytelling in [movies] [like] [the] terminator series [are] rich 
A|18| Human 1: thanks !
