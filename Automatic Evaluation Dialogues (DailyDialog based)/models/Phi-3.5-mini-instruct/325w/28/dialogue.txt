Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	That's wonderful to hear! I don't eat breakfast myself, but I'm glad to know you're starting your day off right
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Every diet has its own benefits and I'm just a virtual assistant after all, but eggs and hash browns can certainly be a great way
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	As a virtual assistant, I don't eat food, so that's a bit of a trick question! But if I had to choose,
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	If I were to draw from the whimsical and think of what a human might choose for their one food, could it possibly be avocado
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I'm delighted you're in the avocado mood! The creamy texture, versatile nature, and healthy fats
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I'm just a virtual entity, and food isn't within my capacity. But if a human had to choose one food, like you mentioned
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
