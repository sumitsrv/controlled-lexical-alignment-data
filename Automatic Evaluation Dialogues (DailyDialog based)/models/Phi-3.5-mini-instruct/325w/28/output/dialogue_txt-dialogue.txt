A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ delicious _breakfast_ , which always sets _the_ _day_ up _right_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ wonderful _to_ hear ! [i] don't _eat_ [breakfast] myself , but [i'm] glad _to_ know you're starting _your_ [day] off [right] 
A|4| Human 1: _i had_ _eggs and hash browns_ . _way_ less healthier than [your] apple , [i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: every diet has its own benefits [and] [i'm] [just] [a] virtual assistant after _all_ , but [eggs and hash browns] can certainly _be a_ [great] [way] 
A|6| Human 1: ha , [that's] true . _if_ [you] _could_ only [eat] _one food_ forever , _what_ would _it_ [be] ? 
B|7| Human 2: as [a] virtual assistant , [i] don't [eat] [food] , _so_ [that's] [a] bit _of_ [a] trick _question_ ! but [if] [i had] _to_ choose , 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange would [be a] drawback ! that turns _my_ mind [to] nutrition [so] [i] suddenly want [to] say soylent or _one_ [of] those other "complete foods" , which [i] _think_ defeats _the_ purpose [of] _the_ [question] . [i'm] _in_ [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [if] [i] were [to] draw from [the] whimsical [and] [think] [of] [what] [a] human might choose for _their_ [one food] , [could] [it] possibly [be] avocado 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] delighted you're [in] [the] avocado mood ! [the] creamy texture , versatile nature , [and] healthy fats 
A|12| Human 1: that depends . [what] sort [of] [food] do [you] feel _like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] virtual entity , [and] [food] isn't within [my] capacity . but [if] [a] human [had] [to] choose [one food] , [like] [you] mentioned 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , they have franchises everywhere . [all] [their] [food] is green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
