A|6| Human 1: oh that's cool ! [i] actually went [to] _an_ _amusement_ park [and] went on [my] _first_ _roller_ coaster ! 
B|7| Human 2: while _i'm not_ capable _of_ physical experiences [and] personal [amusement] , _that_ sounds like [an] exhilarating moment _! i'm_ here [to] help 
A|8| Human 1: _it_ _was_ scary _! it_ _was_ actually _kingda_ ka , _the_ world's tallest _roller_ coaster . ever heard [of] _it_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [kingda] ka's quite [the] feat [! it] reaches speeds up [to] 128 miles per hour [and] [was] [first] opened in 2
