Human 2:	As an AI, I don't have the ability to travel or experience locations like Uganda. However, I can provide you with information
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	That's an inspiring endeavor you embarked on. While I don't have personal experiences or the capacity to travel and volunteer
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	Yes, non-profit organizations around the world orchestrate volunteer projects. They have various initiatives that include building schools, hospitals
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.

Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
