A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ _do_ _you_ think about human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ digital assistant _here_ _to_ help [you] _with_ various topics . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed [to] _have_ made some _great_ _progress_ over last few years . _do_ [you] think _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: it's [great] [to] hear [you] [have] _progressed_ positively . _as_ an _ai_ , _i_ don't [have] personal opinions , but _i_ _can_ provide 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ _impersorsination_ ? though it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ understand [the] joke ! however , [impersorsination] isn't _a_ term commonly used in our _current_ technological landscape . [what] _i_ _can_ clarify 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! some _of these_ bots _are_ very _engaging and_ funny . _they are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ far _are_ _we_ from [the] time _these_ bots start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] certainly [engaging and] quite skilled in [the] art [of] _conversation_ ! while [they] _might_ not [have] [monologues] _as_ humans [do] , [they] _can_ offer 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think it [can] take many different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication _is_ also huge ! it _will_ _signify_ _how_ [ai] research _has_ [progressed] so far [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] _like_ stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] [might] be overselling it [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: your enthusiasm [is] contagious ! [the] journey [of] [ai] [has] been remarkable , [and] [the] "small steps" [like] [these] [progress] [will] indeed lead 
A|12| Human 1: [the] [current] auto-suggestions already [do] pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] indeed impressive ! [the] continuous improvement [and] refinement [of these] ai-driven features [signify] major [progress] in [how] [we] interact _with_ 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice _having_ this [conversation] [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: it's quite [the] [engaging] exchange ! [the] [conversation] you're [having] [with] me [is] [a] direct result [of] [progress] in [ai] [and] natural language processing
