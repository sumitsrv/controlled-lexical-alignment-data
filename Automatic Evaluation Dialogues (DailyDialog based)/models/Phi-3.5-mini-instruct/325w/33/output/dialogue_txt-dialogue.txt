A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to_ make _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ delicious choice ! [croissants] are _a_ classic french pastry . are _you_ ready [to] take on _the_ challenge _of_ making _them_ from 
A|4| Human 1: i've done [them] once or twice so far _, but_ they haven't _been_ _flakey_ _enough_ . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why . what kind [of] cookies _have_ [you] made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad you've had _some_ experience [but] [have] [been] struggling [to] achieve _that_ [flakey] texture . for [croissants] , _the_ key _to that_ 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [it's] _the_ process [of] lamination [you] _need to_ pay _attention to_ . getting _the_ butter layers [to] be evenly distributed _and_ cold [enough] [to] 
A|8| Human 1: _now_ [that] is [a] good idea . i'll give it [a] try next time . would [you] say [you] _have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ [sweet] myself [, but] _i_ understand _that's_ quite human . [now] , for [croissants] , [you] want [to] ensure [that] each layer 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me too , [i] think i'd eat _pastries_ all [the] time if [i] could get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [with] [the] right technique , [you] [don't] _need to_ [have a sweet tooth] _to enjoy_ [pastries] . for [croissants] specifically 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid [attention [to] that] sort [of] stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] _caused_ all sorts [of] crazy _stomach upsets ._ 
B|13| Human 2: [i] apologize for [the] confusion [caused] by [<redacted_term>] [and] [stomach upsets .] [the] process you're referring 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] [need [to] enjoy] sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
