A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to learn_ how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ [great] choice ! [croissants] are _a_ delightful creation _that_ can [make] for _a_ wonderful breakfast _or_ pastry . [it's] _a_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once [or] twice so far _, but_ _they_ haven't _been_ flakey _enough_ . _i'm_ trying _to_ figure _out_ why . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ capable [of] physically making [cookies] [or] [croissants] [, but] [i've] [been] programmed _with_ [enough] information about [them] [to] help [you] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ understand you've [been] [made] [to] [have] [good thought] [but] _i need [to_ make] _a_ clarification , [i'm] phi , microsofts phi 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] is [a] [good] idea . i'll give it [a] _try_ next time . would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [but] [sweet] tooths are [made] [out] [of] sugar for [you] humans [that] [have] [them] . though _i_ [try] [to learn] about your world 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too ,_ [i] _think_ i'd eat _pastries_ _all the_ time if [i] _could_ get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [all] about [the] [sweet] [pastries] [too ,] phi . [but] [don't] [you] [think] [they] [could] [have] [been] [with] [that] [thought] [to] [try] [out] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when _<redacted_term>_ was _being_ _marketed_ as [a] fat _substitute_ , _and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [have] [all the] capabilities [to] process [that] [thought] [with] [the] appropriate [marketed] [substitute] [being] [<redacted_term>] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i need to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
