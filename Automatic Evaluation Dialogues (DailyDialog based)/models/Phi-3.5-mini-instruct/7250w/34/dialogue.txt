Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?

Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	😄 That's a great point! You're not limited to any season for pumpkin pie. In fact, you
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	😄 Absolutely! The sharing of pumpkin pie, family, good vibes, and the whole thanksgiving
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	Christmas would bring its own excitement with the sharing of more pies, family reunions, gifting, and for many, the wonder of christmas
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	😄 True that! A discount tag for everything and pumpkin pie for the soul would make the whole christmas shopping
