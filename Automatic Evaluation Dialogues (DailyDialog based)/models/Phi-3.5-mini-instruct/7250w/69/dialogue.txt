Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't attend parties or have personal experiences. However, I can help you
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, a digital assistant, so I don't consume food like you or your party guests, Turkey, haha! 
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Yes, you're absolutely right! But as a Phi AI, funny expressions like these help to keep the conversation lively. If
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	Haha, you did a great job cooking your sense of humor! But remember, as an AI I do not physically cook or order
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Haha, a chicken turkey party with the Phi 😄 Thanksgiving fun always from home, you got your cook
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Oh, you always have the fun things with your chicken turkey party games 🎉 But don't worry, our home Thanks
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Thanksgiving fun was a blend of games and activities that kept the party engaging from our home turkey oven! Pictionary with paper
