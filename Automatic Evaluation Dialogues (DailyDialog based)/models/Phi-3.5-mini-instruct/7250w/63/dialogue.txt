Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI and do not have the capability for physical travel, kids, or the capacity to join you in
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	While I can't join the trip for you and have fun events, I would be delighted to help plan your Disneyland Christmas eve 
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Traffic and plan for the same have little idea about you, Phi. That might surprise you.  
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Absolutely, that would work perfectly for the plan! Let's look into Airbnb options close to Disneyland in Los Angeles around Christmas
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Good point! Disneyland in the Christmas spirit would have special events and probably not be open for regular visits. Let's think about closeby
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	It's not about the year but your <REDACTED_TERM> you are getting for this time that can influence the plan.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	What about this then:
