Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	Hello! As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal thoughts or feelings. However, I can share insights about human like chat bots
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	Progress in human like chat bots over the last few years have brought about some positives and negatives. 
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	Impersorsination sounds like a made-up term, but I think you might be referring to the impersonation some chat bots have seemed
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	They are far from giving monologues that have the depth and emotional sophistication of human ones. 
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	The progress has indeed been stepping huge strides and overselling might be the human way of expressing that very wonder and possibility. 
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	Yes, auto-suggestions and the progress made in current chatbot technology are already pretty good. They can engage in more natural and coh
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	Indeed! The haha you might find far-fetched now will soon be the very conversation stepping stones that take this technology even further.
