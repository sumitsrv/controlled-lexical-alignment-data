A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back too much _on_ things _, but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have_ been _very_ _favorable_ _for_ me _in_ terms _of_ _time_ spent _with family and friends_ _and_ _work_ _life balance_ . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm glad _to_ hear you've had _a_ [favorable] [and] balanced [time] [for] [work] [and] [life balance] [with family and friends] during 20 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! good _idea_ [to] _help_ people figuring out _their_ new [year] resolutions 🙂 so _how_ do _i_ _get_ [a] fresher _outlook_ ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: reflecting upon [and] identifying _what_ you're grateful [for] can [help] freshen _up_ your [outlook] . _here_ are [a] few suggestions [to] [get] [you] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we _practice_ _that_ ! _i_ think _the idea_ _does_ _have_ _some_ potential . _how_ did [you] come [up] [with] [this] _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai [with] no personal experiences [, but] [the idea] reflects [some] human principles [that] [you] [have] outlined . [a] [practice] 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] is valuable [help] [for] [the] community . _i_ think _mental health_ is _one_ _of_ [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: absolutely ! [mental health] [and] well-being [have] [a] significant impact [on] overall [life] satisfaction [and] productivity . [this] [practice] you're suggesting 
A|10| Human 1: [that] is _actually a_ _quote_ stolen _from_ my tl when _i_ joined my first _company_ after graduation . _i_ guess _now_ after 5 yrs _of_ _work experience_ , _i_ fully _agree with_ it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: it's [great] [that] [you] [have] firsthand [experience] [with] [the] [company] [and] [agree with] [their] philosophy [now] . [that] [does] underscore [how] [work] experiences can [help] us 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; _i_ think [family and friends] _play_ [a] big _role_ [here] . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring around [with] new stuff 3 . multiple _hobbies_ [that] keep [you] busy ... so [on] 🙂 [what] about [you] ? is _there_ [a] _right answer_ [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: while [there] [may] _not_ _be_ [one] [right answer] [that] applies universally [to] everyone's [work experience] [and] [the] [role] [hobbies] [play] [in] [life] satisfaction , [here] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's very_ thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also _music_ earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's very] _true !_ [music] [and] [hobbies] can indeed _be a_ [great] source [of] joy [and] satisfaction . they allow us [to] express ourselves [and] [experience] 
A|16| Human 1: _i_ am _actually_ [not] much [of] [a] reader . _i_ usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] an interesting [quote] [from] "a beautiful mind" [and] [not] [actually a] thought [i] [agree with] . 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! [true !] it [may] turn out [to] [be a] best seller :)
