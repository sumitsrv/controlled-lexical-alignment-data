B|1| Human 2: [hi] 
A|2| Human 1: okay ... so _i_ _need_ someone _to help_ me _though_ _a_ _scenario_ i've been pondering . 
B|3| Human 2: absolutely , _i'm_ here [to help] you _with_ your [scenario] . what's on your mind ? <|end|><|assistant|> if you could share _the_ details 
A|4| Human 1: my partner's former friend invited me _for_ lunch (they _are_ _not_ _in_ _good_ books _right_ now) _. but_ during _their_ friendship _i_ formed an independent bond [with] [the] other person _because_ we _all_ used [to] hang out _a_ lot . _now_ _i_ _feel_ _like_ _i_ have _to take_ sides . 
B|5| Human 2: [i] understand [the] delicate situation you've found yourself [in] _. it's_ [not] uncommon [for] friendships [to take] unexpected turns , and _they_ can 
A|6| Human 1: [i] hope [they] do . getting older already means smaller circles . it sucks [to] lose _friends_ [for] arbitrary reasons . that's _good_ _advice_ _though_ . [i] _fear_ raising [the] issue _might_ sound _like_ treason . lol . 
B|7| Human 2: your concerns [are] valid , and [the] [fear] of potentially damaging friendships _is_ understandable . [in] situations [like] these , maintaining [good] communication and honesty 
A|8| Human 1: _aka_ avoiding _all_ _texts from_ _everyone_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [aka] [not] [everyone] [might] [feel] [the] [need] [for] [texts from] [their] [friends] [all] [the] time , [though] they'd [like] [a] [good] relationship [with] them [. but] 
A|10| Human 1: people _always_ say [to] find [a] _balance_ [but] never say what [the] _balance_ [is] [. it's] used so _often_ _that_ [it's] vacuous . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [often] [the] case [that] [advice] [like] 'find balance' can [feel] quite vague [because] everyone's situation and comfort levels [with] communication [are] unique . 
A|12| Human 1: lol . [i'm] finna be _single_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi , [the] ai , and [it's] [good] [that] you're [single] [right] [now] [because] [balance] [always] starts [with] self-aw
