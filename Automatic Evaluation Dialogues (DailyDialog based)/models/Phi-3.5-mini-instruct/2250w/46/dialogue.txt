Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Absolutely, I'm here to help you with your scenario. What's on your mind?<|end|><|assistant|> If you could share the details
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I understand the delicate situation you've found yourself in. It's not uncommon for friendships to take unexpected turns, and they can
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	Your concerns are valid, and the fear of potentially damaging friendships is understandable. In situations like these, maintaining good communication and honesty
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	AKA not everyone might feel the need for texts from their friends all the time, though they'd like a good relationship with them. But
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's often the case that advice like 'find balance' can feel quite vague because everyone's situation and comfort levels with communication are unique.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI, and it's good that you're single right now because balance always starts with self-aw
