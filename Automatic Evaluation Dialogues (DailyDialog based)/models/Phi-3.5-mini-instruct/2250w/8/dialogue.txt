Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have week experiences, feelings, or personal lives. But
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.

Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence, so I have no plans for the future. However, I can assist you with your queries or tasks

Human 2:	I'm Phi the Phi 13 AI, so I have no physical form or needs for lotion. It seems there'
