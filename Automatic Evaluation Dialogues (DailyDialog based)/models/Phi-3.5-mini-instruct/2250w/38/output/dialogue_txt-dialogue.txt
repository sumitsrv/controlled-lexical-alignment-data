A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ _think_ _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts or feelings [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ share _that_ human-like [chat] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have made_ _some_ great _progress_ _over_ last few _years_ . [do] _you_ _think_ _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] [made] in human-like [chat bots] [over] [the] [years] _has_ been remarkable , _and_ there _are_ [positives] _and_ [negatives] [to] consider: 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [impersorsination] isn't _a_ standard term , but _i think_ [you] _might be_ referring [to] [the] impersonality or lack _of_ [human] touch . [like] 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ [that] ! _some_ [of] these [bots] [are] _very_ _engaging and_ funny . _they are_ now _good at_ _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how far [are] we from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] indeed [good at] [engaging and] simulating [sarcasm] [to] [some] extent ! however , [they] still don't [have] [the] [human] capacity for em 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] _it_ [can] take _many_ different forms [as] [a] product . [the] _research_ implication is also _huge_ ! _it_ will signify how ai _research_ [has] progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle _more futuristic_ problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] [might be] overselling _it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [progress] [you] [are] talking [about] [has] [the] potential [to] steer [research] [and] technology in [many] exciting directions , [like] selling out [even] [more futuristic] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current auto-suggestions_ _already_ [do] pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true] , [the current auto-suggestions] [and] chatbots [have made] [huge] strides , thanks [to] advances in natural language processing [and] machine learning 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice _having_ _this_ _conversation_ _with_ [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [you] [and] [i] [are] [having] [already] demonstrates [the] [progress] [that] [has] been [made] , [with] [this] [very] sophisticated [and] [engaging] exchange . [it]
