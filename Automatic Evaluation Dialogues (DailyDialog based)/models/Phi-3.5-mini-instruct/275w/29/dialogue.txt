Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you! As an AI language model, I don't experience days in the human sense, but I'
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI developed by Microsoft, so I don't attend classes or have part-time roles like you do.
