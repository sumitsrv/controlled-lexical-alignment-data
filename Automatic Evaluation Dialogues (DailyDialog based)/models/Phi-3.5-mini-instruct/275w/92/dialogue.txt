Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't experience days or sun
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Oh, if I had a tan, I'd say it would look like the smooth processing of countless lines of code under a virtual sun!
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	You'd need a beach chair that supports your workstation, Phi! It would be the tech retreat to code under the waves.
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	Nah, you've already got me! But imagine that, an AI researcher sunbathing like a fish out of water.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	Not dangerous, but it's not your regular 9-5 work like humans do. It sounds like you have a very creative career.
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Interesting analogy indeed! Though I must add that as an AI, I don't physically climb mountains. But the concept is
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	I'm flattered you find my indoor gym climbing interesting! But remember, as an AI, I don't have
