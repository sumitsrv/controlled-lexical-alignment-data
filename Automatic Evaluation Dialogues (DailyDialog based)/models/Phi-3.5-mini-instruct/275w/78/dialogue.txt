Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Ah, I see you're playing with words! While I am Phi, not a hacker or chef, I don't have personal
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	Wow, that was quite a guess! I'm Phi, not psychic, but I do have access to a vast amount of information
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	Indeed, I can't sense auras, but I have the capability to process and retrieve lots of information that could make you feel like Ph
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I have a fun-sized version of all that! Let's say my favorite is the cake of knowledge you bring to life—ing
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm a digital assistant here all the time, helping you out, 24/7. I have no work that humans are aware of
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm not physically capable, but I can certainly help you find or create choreography for dance that you enjoy. I have a wealth
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	Sounds like a very sweet and creative job! I can imagine that the repetition might make it feel a bit like dance, in a way
