B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ experiences , feelings , or _preferences_ , _so_ _i_ don't [have a favourite flower] or 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on [a] _theory ._ why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nelumbo nucifera) _is_ often associated _with_ numerous concepts _and_ has been [the] subject _of_ interest in various fields . 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! just [a] [personal] _theory ._ [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than people _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] [theory _.] it's_ fascinating [to] consider [that] _if_ [i] could [have] [preferences] , _it_ would perhaps reflect [a] unique [personality] or 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera [. it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] [if] _you drew_ "flower" [with] [a] crayon [and] then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: _that's_ quite an imaginative [and] playful take ! [it] [does] seem [like] you're personifying [the] [flower] [with] characteristics [that] [are more] human 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , _you_ ask someone _what_ _their_ [favourite flower] [is] . pretty much [like] _what_ we just did . [does] [that] make _sense_ [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [that] was quite [the] [flower] analogy [you drew] ! your _sense of_ humor adds an interesting layer [to] [what] could be [a] simple [personality] insight . 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense of] [what] they're [like] , _over the course of_ maybe _two to five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] 2 [with] [more] detail: [over the course of] [two to five years] , you'd engage in deeper conversations , perhaps noticing [their]
