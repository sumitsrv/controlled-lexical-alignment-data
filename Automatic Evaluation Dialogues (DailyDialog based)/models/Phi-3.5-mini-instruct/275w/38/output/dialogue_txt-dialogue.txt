B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think _about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _and_ while _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts or opinions , _i_ _can_ share _some_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] made [some] great _progress_ _over_ _last few years ._ do _you_ think _the_ _positives_ _outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: advances in _ai_ [have] certainly been substantial [over] [the] [last few years .] _here_ _are_ [some] [positives] _that_ _many_ people consider [outweigh the negatives] 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ _impersorsination_ ? though it _sounds_ _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: ah , [you] _might_ [have] _a_ playful tone in your query ! [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] you're jesting [about] _ai_ impersonating

[the] research implication is also huge ! it will signify how [ai] research _has_ progressed [so] _far_ [and] better place _to_ tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort of _like stepping_ on [the] _moon_ 🙂 [i] [might] be overselling it [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] in [ai] [has] been [like stepping] onto untrodden paths [and] [even] [moon] landing 😊 ! [the] possibilities 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: yes , [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text [are] impressive advancements in [ai] [already] helping [many] users . it's [like] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty _far fetched_ 🙂 nice having this _conversation_ with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [has] been quite [the] journey – [from] ai's moon-like leaps [to] [sarcasm] [about] [far fetched] ideas . it'
