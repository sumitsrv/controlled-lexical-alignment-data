A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think about_ _human_ like chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _so_ _i_ don't _have_ opinions in _the_ [human] sense . however , _i_ _can_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] made _some_ _great_ progress over last few years . do _you_ _think_ [the] positives outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , _and_ _as_ an _ai_ , _i_ don't [have] personal experiences or opinions . however , _i_ _can_ provide [some] analysis based

[the] research implication is also huge ! it will signify _how_ [ai] research _has_ progressed [so] far [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort of like stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be overselling_ it _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: indeed [you] [might be overselling] [the] capabilities [a] bit ! [ai] [and] machine learning [are] progressing rapidly , [and] it's [great] [to] imagine fut 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely , [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text [are very] useful features [that] [ai] [has] [already] improved [to] [a] [great] extent [. they] save
