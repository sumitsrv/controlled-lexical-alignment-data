A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: _is_ _it_ raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i don't_ _have_ real-time access or _the_ ability _to_ check current _weather_ conditions for _you_ , _but_ if you're curious _about_ _the_ _weather_ , 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ [the] _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too_ much . they make days gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: [rain] certainly _can_ _have_ [that] effect , altering [the] mood and landscape . it's _a_ reminder [that] _change_ [is] _a_ natural part _of_ life . 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we _had_ lots [of] _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: [it] sounds [like] your _area_ [had] _to_ deal with challenges as well . [rain] _can_ be _a_ source [of] renewal and nourishment , _but_ [it] _can_ 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive in [that] [weather] ever . _just_ [the] rains at 50 degrees make me want [to] _sit_ in heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: [i] can't physically [sit] anywhere , _but_ [that] imagery helps paint [the] picture [of] comfort on _a_ rainy day . many _people_ indeed find [rain] 
A|10| Human 1: [people] say there [is] drought here ... [but] we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ here ... lol ... never seen [that] in [a] drought ridden [area] 
B|11| Human 2: that's quite [the] contrast ! it's funny _how_ [water supply] [can] be so unpredictable , yet [people] [have] [that] 24- 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay _. climate change_ talk this morning _was_ pretty darn interesting . did [you] see [it] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [was] [just] thinking _about_ [that] [too] ! it's wild _how_ [weather] patterns are shifting [. climate change] [can] lead [to] unpredictable rainf 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking [about] [how] ai [is] helping [climate change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
