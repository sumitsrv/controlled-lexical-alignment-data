Human 2:	 Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?
Human 1:	 Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?

Human 1:	 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.
Human 2:	It's great you're staying cautious and relaxed for the holidays. It's always better to be well for

Human 2:	I'm glad you think that the eco-friendly tree is a responsible option. It's all about making choices that align with sust
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target often has a good selection of eco-friendly decorations and can be a convenient place to find sustainable options for the holiday
