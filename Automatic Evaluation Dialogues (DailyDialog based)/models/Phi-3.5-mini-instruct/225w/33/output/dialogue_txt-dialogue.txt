A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that_ sounds delicious _and_ definitely _a_ fun baking project ! [i'm] here [to] help guide _you_ through _the_ process . [it's] important [to] _have_ 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far _, but_ they _haven't_ been _flakey_ enough . [i'm] _trying to_ figure out _why_ . what kind of _cookies_ [have] [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad [you] brought up your croissant-making experience ! _as_ an ai _, i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] [, but] _i_ can provide 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ human [, but] _the_ challenge intrigues _me_ . here are _a_ few things [you] might want [to] consider _when_ [trying [to] make] [flakey] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] _is_ [a] good idea . i'll give it [a] try next time . _would_ [you] _say_ [you] [have] [a] sweet tooth ?

A|10| Human 1: some people [don't] ! [but] yeah , [me] too [, i] think i'd _eat_ _pastries_ _all_ [the] time if [i] could get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] might _not_ [eat] [them] [, but] [i] can certainly assist [with] [the] process . making [flakey] [pastries] like [croissants] [is] [all] about [the] technique 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort of stuff was [when] <redacted_term> was being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] apologize for [that] . [but] [don't] worry , [as] an ai [, i] am _not_ [the] one [to] overlook food processes . focus 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
