Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	That sounds delicious and definitely a fun baking project! I'm here to help guide you through the process. It's important to have
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm glad you brought up your croissant-making experience! As an AI, I haven't made cookies, but I can provide
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	I'm not human, but the challenge intrigues me. Here are a few things you might want to consider when trying to make flakey
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence. I don't have tastes, but I can understand why you would say that to make
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I might not eat them, but I can certainly assist with the process. Making flakey pastries like croissants is all about the technique
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I apologize for that. But don't worry, as an AI, I am not the one to overlook food processes. Focus
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
