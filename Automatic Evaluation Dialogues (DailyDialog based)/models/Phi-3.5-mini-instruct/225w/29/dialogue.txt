Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you! As an AI, I don't have feelings, but I'm fully operational and ready
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I appreciate your curiosity! I'm Phi, an AI developed by Microsoft. I don't have classes or work part-time.
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!

Human 2:	That sounds like a wonderful resource for tea enthusiasts! The host's knowledge and passion would no doubt make the channel informative and engaging
