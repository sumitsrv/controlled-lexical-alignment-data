A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ doing today ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ heard they [are] giving out _some_ _goodies_ _in_ microkitchen . 
B|3| Human 2: it's always exciting _to_ hear about [goodies] _and_ giveaways ! while [i] can't provide up-to-date news or information

A|10| Human 1: _new york_ ! _nice_ ! best place [to] [live] 🙂 .. right , except [for] [the] [cold] ! 
B|11| Human 2: [new york] does have [cold] winters , but that's [the] beauty _of_ [its] four seasons , contributing [to] [a] diverse climate experience . 
A|12| Human 1: anyways , [i] guess we should better hurry up _to get_ [the] [goodies] . [i] remember last _time_ they ran out [of] it . 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely , [time] management is crucial ! 
A|14| Human 1: [the] one [in] [our] floor . [i] _will_ _get_ by your _desk and_ we can _walk_ there . 
B|15| Human 2: that's [the] plan ! [the] [walk] [will] give us [a] [nice] break from [our] [desk and] [a] chance [to get] [some] fresh air [before] returning [to] work
