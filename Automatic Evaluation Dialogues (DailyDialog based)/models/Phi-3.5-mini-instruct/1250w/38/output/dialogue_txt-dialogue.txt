A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ think _about_ human _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model , _and_ _i_ don't _have_ opinions [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ share 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ [have] made _some_ great _progress_ over last few years . [do] _you_ think _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _as_ an _ai_ , _i_ don't [have] personal beliefs [about] [progress] being [positives] or [negatives] . however , _i_ _can_ provide [some] analytical 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [the] concept _of_ impersorsiation isn't something _i_ [have] programmed _with_ , but _i_ _can_ certainly discuss [it] _from_ _a_ technical or theoretical 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] [of] _these_ bots _are_ very engaging [and] funny . they _are_ now good at _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder _how far_ _are_ _we_ [from] [the] time _these_ bots start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] must clarify [that] while [i] strive [to] engage [and] [even] entertain , [i] [do] not [have] [the] capacity for [sarcasm] or [monologues] . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think [it] [can] take many different forms [as] [a] product _. the_ _research_ _implication_ is _also_ huge ! [it] will signify _how_ _ai research has_ progressed so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic _problems_ 🙂 sort [of] [like] _stepping_ on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] [progress] in [ai research has] been remarkable [and] [stepping] stones [like] impersorsiation [can] symbolize [how far] we've 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ [do] pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: indeed , [auto-suggestions] [and] [the] algorithms [that] drive them [are] [already] tackling complex [problems] efficiently [. the] [implication] [of] [research] [like] impersors 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation [with] _you !_ 
B|15| Human 2: thank [you !] [the] fun [and] creativity [with] which [we] [can] discuss [these] implications [are] [also] quite far-fetched in [the] realm [of] [ai]
