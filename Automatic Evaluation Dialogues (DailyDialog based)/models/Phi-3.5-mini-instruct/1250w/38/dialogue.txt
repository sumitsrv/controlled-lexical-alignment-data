Human 2:	Hello! I'm Phi, an AI language model, and I don't have opinions like humans do. However, I can share
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs about progress being positives or negatives. However, I can provide some analytical
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)

Human 2:	I must clarify that while I strive to engage and even entertain, I do not have the capacity for sarcasm or monologues.
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	Absolutely, the progress in AI research has been remarkable and stepping stones like impersorsiation can symbolize how far we've
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	Indeed, auto-suggestions and the algorithms that drive them are already tackling complex problems efficiently. The implication of research like impersors
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	Thank you! The fun and creativity with which we can discuss these implications are also quite far-fetched in the realm of AI
