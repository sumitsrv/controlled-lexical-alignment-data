Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	I'm here and ready to assist you, 24/7! Just like the park sun, I'm ever-present for help
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	I'm all sunshine through the ether, helping you navigate your day's beach season indoors with information and assistance! What
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	You're the funny one today! 🌞 Just your indoors humor bringing beach vibes, that's pretty
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	Just the day's work here, bringing you some beach fun through words 😄 I'm your indoors fish like,
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	Not dangerous like swimming with sharks, I assure you! It's all about the fun work indoors. Just your virtual fish
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Ah yes, the psychological phenomenon indeed! The indoors fish have their very own mountain climbers, but instead of icy peaks
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	I'm actually not that person who climbs mountains or indoor gyms. 🐟 I'm Phi, Microsoft
