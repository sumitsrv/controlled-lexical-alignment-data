A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do you _have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can share information about flowers . many _people_ [have] [favourite] flowers , often based _on a_ 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm working_ [on a] _theory ._ why does _the lotus_ _spring to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nelumbo nucifera) _is_ culturally rich _and_ has several associations _that_ can [spring to mind] when you' 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, _it's_ not_ _research_ ! _just_ [a] [personal] _theory ._ [i] think [that] _flower _preferences_ are_ _more_ revealing of _personality_ than [people] appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: indeed [, it's] fascinating [that] [personal] [preferences are] [not] [just] whims , but windows into one's [personality] . [the lotus] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as _if_ you drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then it came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's not] [personal] interpretation [i'm working] [with] [, it's] data [and] [theory .] [the gerbera] [flower] has been researched extensively 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , you ask someone what _their_ [favourite] [flower] [is] . pretty much _like_ what we [just] _did_ . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] apologize [if] my responses [did] [not] meet your expectations . [the gerbera] flower's [preferences are] [not] [just] [personal] choices [and] [their] [research] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some more_ , [and] ask them _some more questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] sense of what they're _like_ , _over_ [the] course of _maybe_ two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's like] you're piecing together [the] [personality] puzzle [over] [a] longer period [with] [their] [flower preferences] [and] [maybe] [some more questions] . 
A|14| Human 1: why thank you , that's [a] wonderful idea !
