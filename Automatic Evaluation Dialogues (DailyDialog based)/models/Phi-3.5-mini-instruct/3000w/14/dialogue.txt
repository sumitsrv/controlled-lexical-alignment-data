Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	That's exhilarating 🎢 Just imagine that roller coaster chill and how you could apply it to cool down
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Kingda Ka's 456-foot drop and the speed are actually quite intense, reaching up to 128 mph

Human 2:	I'm not actually built to trust engineering the way you and your co-pilot do. But it's all part of the advent
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	I'm glad you did it, but that's the cool part, we roller coaster through time and experiences together now! Are you
