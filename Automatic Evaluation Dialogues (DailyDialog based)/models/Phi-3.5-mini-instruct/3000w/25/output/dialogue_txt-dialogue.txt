A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , _how are you_ 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ am good . [how are you] ? ：） 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an ai so [i] don't have feelings , but i'm fully operational and ready _to_ assist 
A|4| Human 1: [i] am busy . _a_ lot _of_ _work_ . _what_ _are you working on_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , an artificial intelligence , so [i] don't [work] [on] tasks in the traditional sense [you] might . however , 
A|6| Human 1: [i] am _working _on_ a new_ _classifier_ . 
B|7| Human 2: that's fascinating ! [what] kind [of] [classifier] [are you working on] , phi ? [are you] focusing [on a new] language model _or_ 
A|8| Human 1: [a new] [classifier] _for_ hate speech . which _research topic_ _catches_ your _eyes_ _most_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: the [research topic] that [most] [catches] my [eyes] is advancing natural language understanding [for] ai _to_ better interpret context , sentiment , and semantics in diverse datasets 
A|10| Human 1: nice ! do [you] _refer to_ [work] [or] anything else ? 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [work] [i] [refer to] is [research] and development in natural language understanding [for] ais like myself . 
A|12| Human 1: [you] [are] very cool too !!
