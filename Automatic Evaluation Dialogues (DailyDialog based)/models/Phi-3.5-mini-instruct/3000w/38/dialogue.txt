Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	Hello! As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal thoughts or opinions like humans do. However, I can share insights about human chat
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	Progress made in the development of chat bots like me over recent years is indeed significant. 
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	While the idea of impersorsination sounds like something out of science fiction, chat bots have made some genuine progress and positives include:
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	They are far from giving monologues like human theater plays and engaging in sarcasm that carries emotional baggage and context
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	Indeed overselling can be tempting 😄 The development has implications far and wide, from the progress in machine learning that better
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	The current auto-suggestions and chatbots are already great at engaging in human-like conversation, like sarcasm and even some
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	The conversation you're having with me might already feel pretty sophisticated.
