Human 1:	 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.
Human 2:	I'm just a digital assistant and don't get sick, but your well-being is definitely the priority for healthy holidays
Human 1:	 Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!

Human 2:	1. I like the eco-friendly and responsible aspect of having artificial trees that can disassemble yearly.
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target definitely has a good selection for Christmas trees, and they often have eco-friendly artificial tree options that can be disassembled year
Human 1:	 Great, I hope you find a nice tree.
