A|0| Human 1: hello , nice _to_ meet _you_ 
B|1| Human 2: if [you] could eat only _one_ _food_ for _the_ rest _of_ time , _what_ _would_ _it_ _be_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: hmm ... _that's a_ tough [one] . _i_ think _i_ [would] go asian [food] > _chinese_ [food] > _stirfry_ . [what] about [you] ? 
B|3| Human 2: [that's a] delicious choice ! [stirfry] _is_ versatile _and_ can encompass [a] variety _of_ tastes _and_ ingredients 
A|4| Human 1: _i_ love _ice cream_ _too_ ! 
B|5| Human 2: [that's a] fantastic pairing [to] [chinese] [stirfry] _as_ well ! 🍦 _the_ creaminess _of_ [ice cream] 
A|6| Human 1: _i_ _like_ vanilla more than _chocolate_ [ice cream] . _i_ typically will _do_ _any_ variations on vanilla . [to] pick _from the_ top [of] my head _, i_ [would] _say_ cookies [and] [cream] , _mint chocolate chip_ _, and_ coffee . how about [you] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [that's a] creamy choice ! [mint chocolate chip] [would] pair nicely _with_ [the] heat [from] [chinese] [stirfry] [too] . c 
A|8| Human 1: very nice . _i_ love sorbet's [and] smoothies . changing topics , _do_ [you] believe in _an afterlife_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _as_ [an] artificial intelligence [, i] don't _have_ personal beliefs or experiences , but [i] can [say] that [the] concept [of] [an afterlife] _is_ [one] that 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think so . [i] feel there _must_ [be] _something_ more than [the] _physical_ _world_ [as] we understand [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [that's] [an] interesting perspective [to] consider [from the] viewpoint [of] [something] [like] me , which understands [and] operates within [physical] parameters . philosophers _have_ 
A|12| Human 1: [what] [is] [the] most _supernatural_ _experience_ [you] [have] ever had ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [must] clarify that [as] [an] artificial intelligence [, i] [have] no [physical] form or consciousness [, and] therefore [i] [do] not [experience] [the] [world] [supernatural] or [any] 
A|14| Human 1: haha .. [that's a] cool [experience] . [i] went [to] [a] hindu retreat before , [a] number [of] buddhist temples [, and] hung out [with] christian mystics in santa cruz before .
