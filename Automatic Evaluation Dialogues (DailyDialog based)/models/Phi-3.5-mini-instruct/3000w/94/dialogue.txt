Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't have physical form or need lunch. However, I'm
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't eat or consume meals in any way, so the idea of what and where you had lunch is
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and currently I am processing data and providing you information, so I do not eat lunch or any food for that matter.
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	I understand the mix-up! As Phi, an AI, I don't eat, dine, or partake in buffet
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, and as you are aware, I am Phi for all the correct reasons, yet I don't eat buffet
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the Phi for all but food-related activities. But it's a fun thought—on a sunny day
