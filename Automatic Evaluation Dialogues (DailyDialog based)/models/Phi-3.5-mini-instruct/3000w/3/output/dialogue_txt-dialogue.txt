A|2| Human 1: _is_ it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , and _i don't_ _have_ real-time capabilities or access _to_ current _weather_ data . _to_ find out 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too_ much _. they_ _make days_ gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] digital assistant , and [i don't] experience emotions , _but_ [i] understand [that] [rain] _can_ sometimes [make days] seem glo 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , and [don't] possess personal experiences . _but_ [water] scarcity and [rain] are significant environmental concerns [that] impact 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think _i can_ survive _in_ [that] [weather] ever . just [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit _in_ _heated_ _rroms_ 
B|9| Human 2: that's an _interesting_ interpretation ! while [i don't] yearn for [weather] [like] _a_ human might , [the] impact [of] rainfall [can] be substantial 
A|10| Human 1: _people say_ there _is_ drought _here_ ... [but] we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ _here_ ... lol ... never seen [that] _in_ [a] drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [in] drought-prone regions , [water supply] [can] [have] [the] [rroms] [heated] [too] if [people] [don't] manage [that] carefully . [i can] 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . climate change _talk_ this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did _you_ _see_ it ?
