B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , but _i_ can provide [you] _with_ information about popular flowers _people_ might favor or _the_ characteristics _of_ different flowers 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nymphaea) _is_ often associated _with_ [spring] due [to] several reasons: 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, it's not_ research ! _just_ _a_ [personal] _theory_ . [i] think _that_ _flower preferences_ _are_ more revealing [of] personality than [people] _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] [theory] you're sharing . indeed , in various cultures , [the lotus] [flower] [does] [have a] significant springtime association: 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon _and_ then _it_ came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi _, and_ while [i] [appreciate] [the] creative analogy [, it's not] researched data . [the gerbera] [flower] [does] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their_ _favourite_ [flower] [is] . pretty much _like_ what we _just_ did . [does] _that_ _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [it] [does] [make sense] [that] [personal] [preferences] [like] [flower] [favourite] [are] [not] researched data . [it] involves [personal] taste which can 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with] _the person_ some more [, and] ask them some more questions [, and] gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] what _they're_ [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe _two_ [to] five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] 3: you're [not] [just] [the person] [with] [their] [flower preferences] [, and] [they're] [not] [just] [that] [person] [like] [two] [years] ago; 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
