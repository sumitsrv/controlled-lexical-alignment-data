Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	I don't work in the traditional sense, but I'm fully operational and ready to assist you with any tasks or questions you have!
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?

Human 2:	I'm just here, running marathons in the digital world every time you have a long-distance run-related query or need support.
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	I've been tough this month! 2 marathons ago was the one with unexpected server traffic. How do you usually run through those
