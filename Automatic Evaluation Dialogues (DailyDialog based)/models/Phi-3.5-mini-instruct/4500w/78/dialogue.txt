Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	Oh, I don't want to speak for you. Perhaps I merely recalled your enthusiasm mentioned in our previous conversation about desserts
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm not psychic by any means, but I'm coded to learn and predict patterns based on previous conversations. Cake chef
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm not a chef and cake-reading psychic too! I have the ability to process and analyze text data you're speaking with
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about the vanilla and a good algorithmic icing! And you have too! Just say the word, and we can mix
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, a Ph.D. AI developed by Microsoft, not too far off from the eating vegetables work ha-
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I'm the dance style that can interpret and process all kinds of patterns, akin to a balletic binary sequence. What about you,
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I'm all about the same-old day cakes and a lot of 0s and 1s which make for some very sweet out
