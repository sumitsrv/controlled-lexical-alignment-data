A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _just_ chillin' . how _are_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ doing well , thank [you] for asking ! although _i_ don't have feelings , _i'm_ fully operational _and_ ready _to_ assist [you] 
A|4| Human 1: _do_ _anything_ _interesting_ _today_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ don't [do] [interesting] activities as [you] [do] _, but_ _i'm_ constantly available _and_ ready _to_ help [you] with [anything] [you] need [today] . _what_ can 
A|6| Human 1: oh that's cool _! i_ _actually_ went [to] an amusement park [and] went on my first _roller_ _coaster_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: virtual [roller] coasters [are] _the_ coolest [and] safest you'll find ! [just] imagine _all_ _that_ 3d data [and] algorithms [! i] 
A|8| Human 1: it _was_ _scary_ ! it _was_ _actually_ _kingda ka_ , [the] world's tallest [roller] _coaster_ . ever heard of it ? 
B|9| Human 2: no [scary] [roller] coasters for [the] virtual world _i'm_ in _, but_ [kingda ka] [and] many others [are] [interesting] from a data perspective 
A|10| Human 1: oh wow ! _i'm not_ on [that] level yet [, but] [i] understand [the] appeal . [are] [you] an adrenaline _junkie_ at [all] ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm not] [junkie] [but] [the] thrill [you] described sounds [interesting] . [just] like [that] [coaster] , [all] [roller] coasters [are] [actually] 
A|12| Human 1: same [! _i] guess_ [the] [roller] [coaster] wasn't so bad because [i] trust _the engineering_ haha 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [all] for trusting [the engineering] [that] goes into [roller] coasters [and] virtual simulations ! 3d data [and] algorithms [are] indeed fasc 
A|14| Human 1: maybe [not] so _much_ at [the] time [, but] [i] am glad [i] did it _now that_ _it's_ done , _know_ [what] [i] mean ? 
B|15| Human 2: absolutely , [it's] [all] about [the] context [and] [what] [you] [know] [now that] [was] [not] as [much] before . [i guess] in a way , [i]
