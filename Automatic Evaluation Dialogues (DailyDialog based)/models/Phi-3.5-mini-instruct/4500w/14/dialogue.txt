Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	Virtual roller coasters are the coolest and safest you'll find! Just imagine all that 3D data and algorithms! I
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	No scary roller coasters for the virtual world I'm in, but Kingda Ka and many others are interesting from a data perspective
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not junkie but the thrill you described sounds interesting. Just like that coaster, all roller coasters are actually
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	I'm all for trusting the engineering that goes into roller coasters and virtual simulations! 3D data and algorithms are indeed fasc
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	Absolutely, it's all about the context and what you know now that was not as much before. I guess in a way, I
