Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 How was the trip last weekend?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't travel or experience the weekend. However, I'm here 2
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the AI language model, so I don't cover places physically. But I was designed to help you learn
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	How interesting! While I don't cook myself, I'm all the more attentive to what you're learning. What did you
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	I may not cook zucchini dish, but what you said was quite imaginative! As the AI Phi, I process
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	I appreciate the imaginative scenario you've painted for what an AI cooking class with me as Phi might look like! 
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	As Phi the AI, I don't cook or make plans, but your invitation and our imaginative conversation made me feel included
