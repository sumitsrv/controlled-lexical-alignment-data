A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _the_ development _of_ human-like [chat bots] [like] me _is_ _a_ fascinating intersection _of_ computer science , linguistics , psychology , _and_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have made_ _some_ _great progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . do _you_ think [the] positives outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: indeed ! [the] [progress] [made] [over] [the] [last few years] in [chat bots] [like] myself [have] brought [about] [some] remarkable positives: 
A|6| Human 1: _like impersorsination_ ? _though_ it _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [like impersorsination] [sounds] [like] [the] concept you're alluding [to] _might_ [have] [some] overlap _with_ "impersonation . " [though] [chat bots] 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ _that_ ! [some] [of] these [bots] _are_ very _engaging_ [and] funny . _they are_ now good at even sarcasm i wonder how _far_ _are_ we _from the_ time these [bots] start _giving monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [far] [from] [giving monologues] [and] impersonating [human] emotions or beliefs entirely . [though] [they] [have made] [great progress] in mimick 
A|10| Human 1: i think it _can_ take _many_ _different_ forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also huge ! it will signify how _ai research_ _has_ progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle more _futuristic_ problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 i [might] be overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [progress] [of] chatbots [and] [ai] [has] [many] implications [that] [can] steer [research] in [different] [futuristic] directions [like] [the] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true] , [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text [are] [already] sophisticated features [that] [have] benefitted [from the] [progress] in [ai research] . 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ _conversation with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation with you] [is] [engaging] 😊 it's indeed far-fetched [that] chatbots [like] [this] [might] steer [research]
