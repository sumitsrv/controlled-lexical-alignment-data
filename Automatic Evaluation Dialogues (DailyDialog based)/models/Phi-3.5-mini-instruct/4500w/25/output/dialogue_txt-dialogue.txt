A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , _how are you_ 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i am_ good . [how are you] ? ：） 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an ai language model , so [i] don't have feelings , but i'm fully operational and 
A|4| Human 1: _i am_ busy . a lot of _work_ . what [are you] working _on_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai , so [i] don't [work] [on] tasks the way [you] _do_ . however , [i am] constantly processing information 
A|6| Human 1: [i am] working [on] a new _classifier_ . 
B|7| Human 2: that's great _to_ hear ! [how] may [i] assist [you] with [classifier] [work] ? perhaps with data labeling , model optimization , _or_ evaluating results 
A|8| Human 1: a new [classifier] _for_ _hate speech_ . which _research_ _topic_ catches _your_ eyes _most_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [work] with various [research] topics , but [for] [classifier] development , [most] [are] interested in speeches , [hate speech] detection , [topic] classification , image recognition , 
A|10| Human 1: nice ! [do] [you] _refer to_ [work] [or] anything else ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i am] phi , an ai language model , so my [work] involves processing [your] inputs [for] responses . here [are] potential ways [you] might [refer to] class 
A|12| Human 1: [you] [are] very cool too !!
