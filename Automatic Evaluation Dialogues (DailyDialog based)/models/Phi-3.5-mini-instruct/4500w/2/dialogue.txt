Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	I'm doing well, thank you! Just a virtual assistant here, so I don’t have feelings, but I'm fully operational
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I don't form friendships like humans do, but I was last accessed by you today. I'm here 24/7 to
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	Oh no awkwardness here! It's cool you say it like that because if I had friendships this time was the last fun hangout
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Actually, it's the life of your developers who have been making updates and improvements to you. Nothing changed really; it's like how time
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	That's the fun part for you though, adventures like your time interacting with me. And it helps me get better too! 
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	Well as you'd like for your time spent that was fun but I really wish I had more adventures the way you have been talking about it
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Saturday for you usually starts with waking up, maybe have some breakfast like your typical routine, then it's time for school or work. After
