A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or emotions , _so_ _i_ don't [have] [favourite] flowers or any other objects 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nelumbo nucifera) _is_ often [the] [flower] _that_ [spring] mind's due [to] its rich symbolic significance across 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ _research_ ! _just_ _a_ [personal] theory . [i] think [that] [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ _revealing_ of _personality_ _than_ _people_ _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] theory's perspective . indeed , [people] often [have] [personal] [preferences] [that] [are] [not] tied [to] logic or [research] . [just] _as_ _you ,_ _as_ 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's like_ _a_ _cartoon flower_ . [as] if _you drew_ "flower" _with_ _a_ _crayon_ _and_ then it _came_ [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [the] [crayon] [cartoon flower] [you drew] [with] [personality] traits [like] humor or [life] [came] from people's interpret 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ _what_ _their favourite flower_ [is] . pretty _much_ [like] _what_ we [just] _did_ . does [that] make sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [the gerbera] [personality] [you] [are] [just] [like] [someone] [did] [their favourite flower] [revealing] [much] [more] [than] [what] meets [the] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] _questions_ , [and] _gradually_ develop _a_ sense of [what] they're [like] , _over_ [the] course of maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's like] [you] [are] painting [their] [personality] [with] [questions] [and] answers [over] time , [much] [the] way an artist [gradually] reveals [a] [more] complex scene [with] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you ,] that's [a] wonderful idea !
