B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and while [i don't] _have_ [the] capability _to_ access current _weather_ conditions , [rain] often adds _a_ different rhythm _to_ 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots of _water_ trouble _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: [they] can't [water] [the] gardens [like] [rain] . _but_ [don't] worry ! if you're looking for real-time _weather_ updates , [i] 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] _can_ _survive_ _in that_ [weather] ever . _just_ [the] _rains_ at 50 degrees _make_ me want [to] sit _in_ heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: i'm phi [the] language model , and [don't] worry [i] can't [survive] [weather] or [rains] [in that] [much] [too] ! 
A|10| Human 1: people say there _is_ drought _here_ ... [but] we [have] 24 hours [water] supply _here_ ... _lol_ ... never seen [that] [in] [a] drought ridden area
