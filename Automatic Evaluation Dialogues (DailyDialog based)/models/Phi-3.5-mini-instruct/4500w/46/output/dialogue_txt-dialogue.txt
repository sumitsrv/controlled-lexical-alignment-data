A|2| Human 1: okay ... so _i_ _need_ _someone_ _to_ _help_ me though _a_ _scenario_ i've been pondering . 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ here _for_ you ! _what_ [scenario] _do_ you [need] [help] _with_ ? <|end|><|assistant|> whether _it's_ [a] hypothetical situation , [a] thought experiment 
A|4| Human 1: my partner's former friend invited me [for] lunch (they _are_ _not_ _in_ good books right now) . _but_ during their _friendship_ _i_ formed an independent bond [with] _the_ other person because we _all_ used _to_ hang _out_ [a] lot . _now_ _i_ _feel like_ _i_ have _to_ take _sides_ . 
B|5| Human 2: _i'm_ [not] capable of friendships [like] humans , [but] [i] understand [the] complexity of [the] [scenario] you [are] presenting . 
A|6| Human 1: [i] hope they [do] . getting older already means smaller circles . it sucks _to_ _lose_ friends [for] arbitrary reasons . that's good advice though . [i] _fear_ raising [the] issue _might_ sound [like] treason . lol . 
B|7| Human 2: _i'm_ noting [the] nuance [in] human relationships [for] your [scenario] . your dilemma touches on loyalty , [friendship] dynamics , and 
A|8| Human 1: _aka_ _avoiding all texts from everyone_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [aka] [the] [fear] of social ostracism [for] [not] taking [sides] [might] [feel like] [avoiding all texts from everyone] [out] of [fear] they'll [lose] 
A|10| Human 1: people always say _to_ _find_ [a] _balance_ [but] never say [what] _the balance_ is . [it's] used so _often_ _that_ [it's] _vacuous_ . 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [often] [the] case [that] [what] appears [vacuous] [might] hold deeper wisdom [for] [balance] . [avoiding] [texts] [all] [from] [fear] of [not] knowing where [to] 
A|12| Human 1: lol . [i'm] finna be _single_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] glad [that] [the balance] [often] referred [to] [might] [now] [find] its finer points [with] [someone] [single] ! [a] [vacuous] statement [like] [avoiding] [texts] [all]
