B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do you _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , an ai language model , _so_ _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ , feelings , or favorites . however , 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ?

A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some _more_ , [and] ask them some _more_ questions , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] _of_ what they're [like] , _over the course of_ maybe _two to five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: indeed ! [over the course of] [two to five years] , you're [more] likely [to] gain [a] deeper understanding [and] appreciation [of] [their] [personality] [and] experiences 
A|14| Human 1: why thank you , that's [a] wonderful idea !
