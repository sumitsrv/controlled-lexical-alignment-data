B|3| Human 2: hello there ! _i'm_ phi , _an_ ai digital assistant _. i_ don't have superpowers like _a_ [superman] , but [i] 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . _you_ won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: ah , [i] [see] [the] playful reference ! while _i'm_ _not_ [invisible] like [the] superheroes [you] might be thinking of , _my_ presence _is_ 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do this [. i] [am] [not] [an] expert on that . sorry _for_ it !

A|12| Human 1: no [, i'm] bad at [science] . what [can] [science] do ? [is] it [the] most important thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] , especially fields like functional magnetic resonance [imaging] (fmri) [and machine learning] , plays [a] crucial role [in] advancing our understanding
