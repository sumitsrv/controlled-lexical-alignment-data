A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human like chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! _as_ an _ai_ language model , _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts , but _i_ _can_ provide [you] _with_ _some_ insights _on the_ topic _of_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have made_ [some] great _progress over_ last few _years ._ do [you] _think_ [the] _positives_ outweigh [the] _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: it’s _true that_ chatbots [have made] significant [progress over] [the] [years .] here's _a_ basic breakdown _of_ [some] [positives] _and_ [negatives] 
A|6| Human 1: like _impersorsination_ ? though it sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [impersorsination] isn't [the] right term . _i think_ [you] _might be_ referring [to] "impersonality" . chatbots , indeed , 
A|8| Human 1: [true that] _! some_ [of] these bots _are_ very _engaging and_ _funny ._ they _are_ now _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ far _are_ _we_ from [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: that’s an intriguing thought [! some] _ai_ _has_ started [to] generate creative [and] [engaging] content [that] _can_ indeed come across _as_ witt 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it [can] take many different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication is also huge ! it will signify _how_ [ai] research [has] progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] like _stepping_ [on the] moon 🙂 [i] [might be] overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [the] advancement in [ai] [has] been quite remarkable [and] [stepping] 'into [the] moon'—metaphorically speaking—is [a] fant 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] language models [are] [already] quite advanced , making them [more] efficient [and] sometimes [even] [funny .] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: it's all in [good] fun ! [i] love [how] [we] [can] [have] [engaging and] creative discussions . let me know if [you] [have] [more] thoughts
