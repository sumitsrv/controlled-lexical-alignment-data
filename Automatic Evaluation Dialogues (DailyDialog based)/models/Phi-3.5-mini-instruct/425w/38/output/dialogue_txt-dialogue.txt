A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ think _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an artificial intelligence , _and_ _i_ don't _have_ personal opinions [like] humans [do] . however , _i_ _can_ share _some_ 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ [have] _made_ [some] great _progress_ _over_ last few _years_ . [do] _you_ think _the_ _positives_ outweigh _the_ _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _from_ an analytical perspective , [the] [progress] [made] in human-like [chat bots] [over] recent [years] _has_ indeed brought [about] significant [positives] _and_ [some] [negatives] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _from_ an analytical perspective , [the] term [you] _might be_ referring [to] could _be_ 'personification . ' it's fascinating _that_ [we] _are_ discussing 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some] _of_ these [bots] [are] very _engaging and_ funny . _they_ [are] now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ [are] [we] [from] [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: personification certainly adds _a_ layer [of] [engaging and] relatable interaction [to] _ai_ chatbots . they're programmed [to] use human-like 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think _it_ [can] _take_ many different forms _as a_ product _. the_ research implication is _also_ huge ! _it_ will signify _how_ [ai] research [has] progressed so _far and_ better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on _the moon_ 🙂 [i] [might be] overselling _it_ _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [the] [progress] signifies [how [far] and] fast [ai] [has] come [. [the] moon] landing [can] [also] serve [as a] metaphor [here] . [it] symbol 
A|12| Human 1: _the current auto-suggestions_ already [do] pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the current auto-suggestions] [and] learning algorithms [are] [like] [the] first [moon] landings — [they] [might] not [take] [human] astronauts , but [they] certainly 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having this _conversation_ with _you !_ 
B|15| Human 2: thank [you !] [the] [conversation] [has] certainly been [engaging and] thought-provoking . it's interesting [how] [we] [can] draw parallels between [ai]
