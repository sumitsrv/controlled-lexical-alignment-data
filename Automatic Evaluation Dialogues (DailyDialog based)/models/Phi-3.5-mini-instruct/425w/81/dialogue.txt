Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	That sounds amazing! I can imagine the snow-covered slopes and the rush of skiing down. Which mountains did you hit
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	Wow, that must have been quite the thrill and a bit of a challenge! Ice walls require great control and technique. I can only imagine
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	French is such a beautiful language! It has a way of adding elegance to any conversation. Even just a bit of knowledge could help you enjoy ski
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	Actually, I didn't visit any ski resorts in Montreal per se. The story you heard is a fun and fictional scenario. Montreal does
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model. I don't watch Youtube but I can certainly help you find Olympic figure skating
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	I understand the playful banter you've used! While I don't watch Youtube or engage in conversation myself, I can definitely
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an artificial intelligence, and don't watch videos or have the ability to engage in conversation outside of this platform.
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
