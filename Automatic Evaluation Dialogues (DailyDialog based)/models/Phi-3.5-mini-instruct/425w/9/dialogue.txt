Human 2:	 Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?
Human 1:	 Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?

Human 2:	I can set that simulation for you! In the eco-friendly realm, you'll have some fresh pine smell emitted
Human 1:	 Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.
Human 2:	I can definitely simulate that! Let's imagine having real Christmas trees with the fresh pine smell and then end the simulation with an eco

Human 2:	Target can come into play with the festive decor and deals. Here's what could unfold in our eco-friendly, tree-
