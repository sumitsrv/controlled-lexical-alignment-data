Human 2:	It's quite poetic you mentioned turkey with a playful twist! I'm always delighted to engage in fun wordplay
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	I'm just an AI, so I don't play games or parties, but that's a fun image you've conjured
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	I'm glad you enjoyed the imaginative games and fun scenarios! While I can't participate in them, it's always enjoy
