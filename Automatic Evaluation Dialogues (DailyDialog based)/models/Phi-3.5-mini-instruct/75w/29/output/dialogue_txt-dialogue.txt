A|6| Human 1: oh _that_ _is_ awesome ! [for] some reason [i] assumed _it_ was [a] college [class] [, but] [a] _sewing_ [class] _sounds_ way better ! [i] [work] _full_ [time] [, [but] i] take _pottery_ classes [from] [time] _to_ [time] !

A|12| Human 1: ahh , those [are] mostly [from] japan , no ? [i] [like] white _teas_ , [like] _silver needle_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [silver needle] [tea is] quite refreshing ! speaking [of] tradition , [pottery] [is] an art [that] has been practiced [for] thousands [of] years . 
A|14| Human 1: [i] actually found [a] youtube _channel_ called <redacted_term> [that] [i] _like a_ lot . [you] should check [it] out _! the_ host talks about all kinds [of] different _teas_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [it's] wonderful [that] [you] appreciate both [teas] and [the] art [of] [pottery] [! the] [channel] certainly seems [like a] treasure trove [of] information .
