Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	Apologies if it seemed robotic! I'm Phi, an AI here to assist you. While I don't plan like humans
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	I understand you're looking for something quirky! While kale isn't a traditional theme for Thanksgiving, I can certainly help
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	As Phi, the AI, I do not interact with either humans or computers in the same way they do. I am programmed to process
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	As Phi, I am not capable of having personal preferences since I am an AI language model. However, I can talk about programming languages
Human 1:	 Yes!
Human 2:	Absolutely! Here's a fun fact: Python is often described as "executable pseudocode" because of its readability and straightforward syntax
Human 1:	 lol
