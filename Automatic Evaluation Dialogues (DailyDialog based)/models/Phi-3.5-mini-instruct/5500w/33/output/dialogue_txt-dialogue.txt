A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to learn how to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [croissants] are _a_ delicate pastry _that's_ [great] [to learn how to make] ! _it_ involves laminating butter into _the_ dough 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them _once_ or twice so far _, but_ they haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . _i'm_ trying [to] figure out why . what _kind_ of _cookies_ _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] _you have_ quite _a_ [flakey] [croissants] challenge ! _it_ seems like we went off-topic about [cookies] . 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] _you have_ [been] quite _the_ [flakey] [croissants] enigma ! [it's] [good] we touched on [cookies] [once] . 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ _is a_ [good] idea . _i'll_ give [it] [a] try _next time_ . would [you] say [you have] [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [but] [you have] [been] quite thoughtful _with_ your [croissants] conundrums . _and_ [sweet tooth] [is a] [kind] [that] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , _me_ _too_ , i think i'd eat _pastries_ _all the_ _time_ if i _could_ _get_ away [with] [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'll] remember [that] [with] [all the] [pastries] [you] _enjoy_ . [it] [could] [make] [next time] more relevant [to] [you] [too] . [but] [don't] [get] [me] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] i paid attention _to that_ sort of stuff was _when_ _<redacted_term>_ was _being_ marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [when] [you] alluded [to that] past marketing fiasco [with] [<redacted_term>] [being] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution i need [to] [enjoy] sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
