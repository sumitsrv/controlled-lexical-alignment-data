Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	As an AI, I don't experience days, but I'm here and fully operational. How can I assist you today?<|end|>

Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI and not from anywhere originally like humans are. But I can share information about it! Australia is well-
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Australia's southern lights are actually the Aurora Australis and can be quite a sight to see from outdoor locations like Tasmania or over in
