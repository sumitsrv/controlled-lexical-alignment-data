A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is _it_ raining pretty bad _today_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , and i'm based on text interactions , so _i don't_ _have_ real-time _weather_ capabilities . _to_ know [today] 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early _this_ year ... [i don't] _like_ them too much . they _make_ _days_ gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ language model , so [i don't] experience _weather_ [like] [rain] . [i] understand [that] rainy [days] might [make] 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots _of_ _water_ trouble too ... 
B|7| Human 2: that's [the] beauty [of] [rain] for some , though . [it] nourishes crops , fills rivers , and _can_ [make] [that] cozy , ra 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive in [that] [weather] _ever_ . just [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] _me_ want [to] sit in _heated_ rroms 
B|9| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , [ever] [heated] or iced can't [make] _a_ difference for [me] . _but_ [weather] [like] [that] does 
A|10| Human 1: _people_ say _there_ is _drought_ _here_ ... [but] we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ _here_ ... _lol ..._ _never_ _seen_ [that] in [a] _drought ridden area_ 
B|11| Human 2: indeed , [water supply] [can] [make] all [the] difference [here] on earth . it's essential for survival , [but] [there] [have] been droughts [that] tested 
A|12| Human 1: _hmm ...._ okay . climate _change_ _talk_ _this_ morning was pretty darn _interesting_ . did _you_ see [it] ? 
B|13| Human 2: [interesting] [hmm ....] water's [the] [talk] [but] [people] [never] [change] [drought ridden area] [lol ...] [have] [you] [seen] [this] [weather] data [that] shows 
A|14| Human 1: they were talking about how [ai] is helping climate [change] . nice use [of] upcoming tech .
