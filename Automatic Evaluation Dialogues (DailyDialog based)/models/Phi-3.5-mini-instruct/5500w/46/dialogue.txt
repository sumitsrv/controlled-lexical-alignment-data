Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Of course, I'm here to help. What scenario would you like to ponder through?<|end|><|assistant|> Please feel free to share the details,
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I'm not the person they invited for lunch now, but I can help you with some thoughts. 
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I understand the concern for raising the issue might feel like betraying friends' trust, but open communication is key in friendships. 
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	That's a possibility if the texts feel like they are avoiding the issue. But I hope not. Lol. 
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	It's not vacuous but often used because it rings true for many. A balance in friendships means being honest and open while also respecting
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm here to help with the balance, AKA single but always available for advice on friendships. Lol, it's often
