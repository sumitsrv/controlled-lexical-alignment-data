A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do you _have_ a _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ or feelings , _so_ _i_ don't [have] [favourite] flowers or any other subject matter 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on a _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ often [the] [spring] _of_ [mind] in literature , mythology _, and_ psychology for various reasons: 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! _just_ a [personal] _theory_ . [i] think _that_ [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ than people _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [appreciate] [the] [theory] you're presenting . [the lotus] [flower] [does] [have] significant symbolism across different cultures: 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's_ _like_ a _cartoon_ [flower] . [as] if you drew "flower" _with_ a _crayon_ [and] then _it_ _came to life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi _, and_ [it's not] [that] [the gerbera] [came to life] [with] [crayon] [like] in cartoons . [it] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , you ask someone _what_ their [favourite] [flower is] . pretty much [like] _what_ we _just_ did . [does] [that] make sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] apologize for [the] confusion . [the gerbera] [flower] [does] [not] [spring] from [cartoon] [life] [with] [crayon] [like] you've [just] creatively 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some more_ [, and] ask them _some more questions_ [, and] gradually _develop_ a sense [of] _what_ they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i] see [what] you're aiming for . here [are] [some more questions] [that] could [develop] [the] [personality] [and] interests [over] [years] [like] [with] someone's 
A|14| Human 1: why thank you , that's a wonderful idea !
