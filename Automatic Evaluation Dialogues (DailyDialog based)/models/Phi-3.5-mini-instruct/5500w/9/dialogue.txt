Human 1:	 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.

Human 2:	I'm just the holiday lights and festive tunes that can come and go with your eco-friendly Christmas tree plan every year
Human 1:	 Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.
Human 2:	I'm just the holiday lights and festive tunes that come with a tree plan which can change every year for eco-friendly
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Target often provides Christmas trees and decor with eco-friendly options for the festive lights every year. There's also the joy that real
