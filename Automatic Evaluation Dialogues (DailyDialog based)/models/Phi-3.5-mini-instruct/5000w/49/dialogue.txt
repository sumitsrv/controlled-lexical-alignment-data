Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, so I don't experience days, but I'm ready and functioning well!
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have the ability to anticipate weekends or engage in personal activities. I'm here 2
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, your AI, and live the weekend watch you are not really looking forward to or going to do. 
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Although I can't watch live events or sharks swim, the humor you reference is fun to hear! 
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Haha, sounds like you're really looking forward to the weekend this time around! Even though I can't actually watch UFC tournament
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	It's pretty competitive but I can give you the fun and excitement of training and jiu-jitsu spirit! You should try out
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I'm just going through the motions and might not actually win anything, but that competitive spirit will still give this weekend training fun.
