Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't experience days, but I'm fully operational and ready to assist you
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I'm sorry to hear that your moped broke down and caused this inconvenience. While I can’t fix the moped for you
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I'm Phi and the situation is out of my control. The moped's break down seems to be a result of using diesel
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and the situation you're describing here sounds like that. I don't drive, but good to know your work-
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	I'm Phi and the Warriors game last night was quite good, they should have won that last-minute drive. That moped
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	True that their record catches the eye. The moped situation sounds challenging but don't you think getting alternative transport today should be your priority
