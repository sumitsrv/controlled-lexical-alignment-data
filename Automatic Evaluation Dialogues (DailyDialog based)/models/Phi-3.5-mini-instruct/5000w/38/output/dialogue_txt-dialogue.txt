A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ think _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't _have_ personal thoughts or feelings , but _i_ _can_ certainly discuss [about] human-like [chat bots] [like] myself . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ _some_ great _progress_ _over_ _last few years_ . do _you_ think _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [the] [progress] [made] in [the] development _of_ human-like [chat bots] [over] [the] [last few years] [have] indeed been significant . 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? though _it_ _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] [the] concept you're referring [to] – [the] blending _of_ [human] interaction _with_ artificial intelligence in chatbots . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! _some_ [of] these [bots] _are_ very engaging _and_ funny . _they are now_ good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ _far_ _are_ we _from the_ time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are now] sophisticated [and] contextually appropriate . [some] [even] [have] [the] ability [to] engage in small talk [that] [sounds] human-like , which 
A|10| Human 1: [i] think _it can_ take _many_ different forms [as] a product _. the_ research implication is also huge ! _it_ will signify _how_ _ai_ research _has_ progressed so _far and_ _better_ place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling _it_ _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely ! [the] [progress] [has] implications [far and] wide [from the] technology itself [to] [how] [it can] [better] [human] interaction , productivity , [even] mental health 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] [like] [the] stepping-stones [here] [already] [. the] [auto-suggestions] [and] predictive text [can] engage [more] naturally in [human] dialog 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 _nice_ having this _conversation_ [with] _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [nice] [conversation] indeed ! [the] [progress] [you] talk [about] [with] sophisticated [and] context-appropriate [ai] [has] [the] potential [to] revolutionize [many] aspects
