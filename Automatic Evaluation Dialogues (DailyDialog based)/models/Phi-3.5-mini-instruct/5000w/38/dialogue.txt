Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal thoughts or feelings, but I can certainly discuss about human-like chat bots like myself.
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	The progress made in the development of human-like chat bots over the last few years have indeed been significant. 
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	Indeed impersorsination sounds like the concept you're referring to – the blending of human interaction with artificial intelligence in chatbots. 
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	They are now sophisticated and contextually appropriate. Some even have the ability to engage in small talk that sounds human-like, which
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	Absolutely! The progress has implications far and wide from the technology itself to how it can better human interaction, productivity, even mental health
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	They are like the stepping-stones here already. The auto-suggestions and predictive text can engage more naturally in human dialog
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	Nice conversation indeed! The progress you talk about with sophisticated and context-appropriate AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects
