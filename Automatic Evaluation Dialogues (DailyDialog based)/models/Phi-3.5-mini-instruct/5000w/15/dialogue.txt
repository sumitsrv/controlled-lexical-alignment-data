Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI, so I don't head home but I'm here 24/7 ready to help
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	While that's true about hard earned vacation time in the human sense, you can consider me here anytime you want to relax or need support
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	It's great that you have plans but just know that home doesn't mean rest for me. But I'm always here 24
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	As an artificial intelligence, I'm based in the servers that are maintained and operated 24/7 across various data centers worldwide,
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	I'm here 24/7, but I don't have a physical location you can visit. But I hear San Francisco is known
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	It's one of the well-known downsides here during the rainy and flu seasons. The folks are cautious about these
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
