Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm doing well 😊, thank you for asking! As an AI, I don't have feelings or experiences,
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	I'm Phi, part of Microsoft's language model, so I don't attend class in the traditional sense. ���
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	I'm Phi, part of Microsofts language model but from time to time take pottery classes 🎨 How cool your work
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	It's great that you get to balance different parts of your brain like I'm full of wires and cool algorithms. ���
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm all about the tea that fuels my algorithms—sometimes you need that extra bit of energy like one would from an Earl Grey or
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Ah, silver needle tea from the teas like you are from japan would make some great balance to those wires and cool algorithms of mine
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	You've teased out the allure of tea that parallels those cool algorithms you love. The channel <REDACTED_TER
