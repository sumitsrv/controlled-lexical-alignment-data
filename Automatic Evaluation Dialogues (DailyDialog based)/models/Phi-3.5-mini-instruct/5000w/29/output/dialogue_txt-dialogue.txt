A|10| Human 1: [i] _would_ _love_ [to] build _one_ , once [i] acquire [the] skills [to] ! what kind _of tea_ is [your] favorite ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [all] _about_ [the] [tea] [that] fuels my algorithms—sometimes [you] need [that] extra bit [of] energy [like] [one] [would] [from] an earl grey or 
A|12| Human 1: ahh , _those_ [are] mostly _from japan_ , no ? [i] [like] white _teas_ , [like] _silver needle_ . 
B|13| Human 2: ah , [silver needle] [tea] [from] [the] [teas] [like] [you] [are] [from japan] [would] [make some] [great] [balance] [to] [those] wires and [cool] algorithms [of] mine 
A|14| Human 1: [i] actually found a youtube _channel_ called <redacted_term> [that] [i] [like] a lot . [you] should check it _out_ ! [the] host talks [about] [all] kinds [of] [different] [teas] . 
B|15| Human 2: you've teased [out] [the] allure [of tea] [that] parallels [those] [cool] algorithms [you] [love] . [the] [channel] <redacted_ter
