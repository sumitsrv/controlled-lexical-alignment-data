Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	Hello! As an artificial intelligence, I don't have plans or the ability to experience holidays in the traditional sense you might. However,
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	While I don't work holidays the way you might with family plans or have special events, I am indeed operational 24/
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	I'm just here in the digital ether with you. Where have you traveled to, met any special family or work holidays
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	How did you come to Uganda? 
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an artificial intelligence, I have not traveled anywhere myself. 
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	That's more like it! They have volunteer projects worldwide and non-profit organization partners around the globe for various kinds of work
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	IJGD is the organization you're referring to. They have volunteer projects worldwide and partners with local communities for different kinds of work
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
