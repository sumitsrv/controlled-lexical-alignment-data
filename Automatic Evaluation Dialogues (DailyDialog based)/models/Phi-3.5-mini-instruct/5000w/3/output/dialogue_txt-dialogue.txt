B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is it raining pretty bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , and _i don't_ _have_ real-time capabilities or access _to_ current _weather_ data . _to_ find out 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started early this year ... [i don't] _like_ them _too_ much . they _make_ _days_ _gloomy_ 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] digital assistant , and [i don't] experience emotions [like] [gloomy] [days] . however , [rain] _can_ certainly affect _people_ 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots of _water trouble_ _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: it's _interesting_ [that] _you_ [make] [the] connection with [water trouble] . as an _ai_ , [i don't] _have_ _a_ personal history [like] humans do . 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... [i don't] think [i] [can] survive _in_ [that] [weather] ever . _just_ [the] rains at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit _in_ _heated rroms_ 
B|9| Human 2: that's an imaginative take ! [just] [like] [the] [heated rroms] [can] [make] _you_ feel cozy and warm , [weather] data [that] [i] 
A|10| Human 1: [people] say there is _drought_ _here_ ... _but_ we [have] 24 hours _water supply_ _here_ ... lol ... never seen [that] _in_ [a] _drought_ ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [just] [like] [that] [heated rroms] [can] provide comfort , [water supply] systems [have] [the] crucial role [in] [drought] affected areas [too] ! they're 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was pretty darn [interesting] . did [you] see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: indeed ! [climate change] [can] [have] drastic impacts [like] [water] scarcity [but] also [the] [heated rroms] you're _talking about_ [here] are 
A|14| Human 1: they were [talking about] how [ai] is helping [climate change] . nice use of upcoming tech .
