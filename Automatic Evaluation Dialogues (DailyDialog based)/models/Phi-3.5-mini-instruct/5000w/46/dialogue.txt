Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	I'd be glad to help you with that scenario. Please go ahead and tell me what you need assistance with. 
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.

Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm not endorsing the idea of single lol but it's understandable that the conversation might feel a bit light-hearted
