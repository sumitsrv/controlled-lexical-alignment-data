A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks _. i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ wonderful baking project ! [it's] quite _a_ craft _that_ requires patience _and_ precision [. i'm] here [to] help _you_ through 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once or twice so far _, but_ they _haven't been_ flakey _enough_ [. i'm] trying [to] figure out why . what _kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ [you] made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] glad _you have_ _some_ croissant-making experience; flakiness in [cookies] (or [croissants] , in this case) often comes 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [it's] _the_ butter layering _i_ [haven't been] getting [enough] [of] . _you have_ [to make] sure they're thin [but] _not_ _too_ thin 
A|8| Human 1: _now_ [that] is [a] _good_ _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try _next_ time . would [you] say [you have] _a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [a sweet tooth] [kind of] croissant [but] [you have] an [idea] [that] seems quite tasty . what's [next] in _the_ process 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people don't ! [but] yeah , me [too] , [i] think i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ [the] time if [i] _could_ _get_ away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [with] [you] on [the] [pastries] [too] . [now] , [that] [next] step [could] be [all] about achieving [that] flaky goodness . 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] _stuff_ _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat _substitute_ , [and] caused _all sorts of_ crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [get] [that] [the] [idea] [was] [to make] [pastries] [and] [all sorts of] [good] [stuff] healthier [, but] [when] [you] [substitute] <redacted_ter 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
