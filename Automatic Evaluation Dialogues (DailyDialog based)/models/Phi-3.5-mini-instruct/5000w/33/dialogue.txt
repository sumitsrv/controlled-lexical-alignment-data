Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	That's a wonderful baking project! It's quite a craft that requires patience and precision. I'm here to help you through
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm glad you have some croissant-making experience; flakiness in cookies (or croissants, in this case) often comes
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	It's the butter layering I haven't been getting enough of. You have to make sure they're thin but not too thin
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I'm a sweet tooth kind of croissant but you have an idea that seems quite tasty. What's next in the process
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I'm with you on the pastries too. Now, that next step could be all about achieving that flaky goodness. 
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	I get that the idea was to make pastries and all sorts of good stuff healthier, but when you substitute <REDACTED_TER
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
