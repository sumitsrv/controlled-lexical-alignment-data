A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think about_ _human_ _like_ chat bots ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello there ! _as_ an artificial intelligence , _i_ don't _have_ personal opinions [like] _a_ [human] would . however , _i_ _can_ share insights [about] _the_ topic 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ [have] _made_ _some_ _great_ _progress_ _over_ last few _years_ . do _you_ _think_ _the positives_ outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: it's [great] [to] [think about] [the] [progress] [made] in human-like chatbots [over] [the] [years] ! [the positives] definitely [have] [some] significant impacts 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? though _it sounds_ far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [impersorsination] , [you] say ? [it sounds] [like] [you] _might be_ referring [to] [the] impersonation _of_ human-like chatbots . _this_ _is_ 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! [some] [of] these bots _are very_ _engaging_ _and_ funny . _they are_ _now_ good _at_ even sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] time these bots start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: _a_ monologue [from] _a_ chatbot would certainly _be_ an [engaging] topic [and] _a_ sign [of] advanced _ai_ ! [they are] getting _better_ [at] _conversation_ [and] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] [think] [it] [can] take many _different_ _forms_ [as] [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] also _huge_ ! [it] will signify how [ai] _research_ has progressed so far [and] [better] place [to] tackle _more_ _futuristic problems_ 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping _on the_ moon 🙂 [i] [might be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] potential [is] immense [and] [futuristic problems] [like] [more] sophisticated [forms] [of] [human] interaction [are very] much [on the] horizon . 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current _auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty_ good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: definitely ! [the] [auto-suggestions] [and] conversational capabilities [are] [already] [pretty] sophisticated . they're based [on] [huge] datasets [and] machine 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] far fetched 🙂 nice having [this] [conversation] _with_ [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [conversation] [might] indeed seem far-fetched , but [with] [the] continuous [progress] [and] [research] in [ai] , [this] [might] not [be] too [different] [from] [now] .
