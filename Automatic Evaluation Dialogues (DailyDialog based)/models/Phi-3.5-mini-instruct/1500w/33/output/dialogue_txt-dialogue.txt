A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to_ _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: making [croissants] _is_ quite _the_ adventure ! [it's] _a_ labor-intensive french pastry _that_ involves creating layers _of_ buttery d 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once _or_ twice _so_ far _, but_ they _haven't_ _been_ flakey enough . _i'm_ trying _to_ figure _out_ why . what kind [of] _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an ai language model , [so] _i_ [haven't] [made] [cookies] in _the_ traditional sense [, but] _i_ [have] [been] programmed 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi [, but] let's [have you] [out] for _a_ [thought] experiment – _if i could_ bake [cookies] , _i'd_ probably [make] 
A|8| Human 1: now [that] [is] [a] good _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try _next_ _time_ . would [you] _say_ [you] _have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi , an ai language model [that] doesn’t [have a sweet tooth] [or] [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ understand _the_ [idea] [you] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me too , [i] think [i'd] eat _pastries_ _all_ [the] _time_ [if i could] get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'd] [say] [pastries] [could] be [the] [next] best thing [to] [cookies] [with] [all] [that] flaky goodness _and_ sweetness . [but] don’t forget 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last _time_ [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [don't] [have] personal experiences [, but] [that] [was] an interesting [time] [when] [the] market [and] scientific communities were navigating health [and] nutrition topics . 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
