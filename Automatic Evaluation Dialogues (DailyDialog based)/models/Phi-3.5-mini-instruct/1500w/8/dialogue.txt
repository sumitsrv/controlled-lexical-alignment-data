Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Hello! As an AI, I don't experience weeks or days. However, I'm here and ready to assist you with any information
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I'm really sorry to hear you're not feeling your best 😟 I wish I could be there for you in the sense
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm an artificial intelligence, so I don't have the capacity for physical ailments or budget constraints. I wasn't traveling
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as you rightly pointed out, I'm an AI and don't have plans,
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, the Microsoft language model, and I don't have physical experiences like humidity. However, it's interesting
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	I'm Phi, an AI language model, and I don't have the ability to carry lotion or physical experiences like humid
