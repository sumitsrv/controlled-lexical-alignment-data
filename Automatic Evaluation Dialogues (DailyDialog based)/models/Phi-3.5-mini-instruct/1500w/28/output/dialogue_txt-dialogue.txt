B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _great_ , thanks . _i_ _just_ ate _a_ _delicious_ _breakfast_ , which always sets _the day_ up right . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] glad _to_ hear _that_ _your_ [breakfast] was [a] [great] start _to_ [the day] ! while [i] don't _eat_ _, i'm_ _all_ ears _and_ 
A|4| Human 1: [i] had _eggs_ [and] hash browns . _way_ less healthier than [your] apple [, i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] virtual assistant , [and] [i] don't _have_ [the] ability _to_ _eat_ , but [your] [breakfast] choice sounds [delicious] ! [eggs] 
A|6| Human 1: ha , _that's_ _true_ . if [you] could only [eat] _one_ _food_ forever , what _would_ it _be_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] line _of_ code [and] don't [eat] either [way] . but _in_ [the] human world , _that_ _would be_ quite fascinating ! 
A|8| Human 1: yeah _, turning_ orange [would be] [a] drawback ! [that] turns my mind [to] _nutrition_ so [i] suddenly want [to] _say_ _soylent_ or _one_ [of] _those_ other "complete foods" , which _i think_ defeats [the] purpose [of] [the] question . [i'm] [in] [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [just] [a] string [of] code [and] don't [eat] either [way] , [true] [that] . [soylent] [would] indeed [be] quite [the] [nutrition] 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant . [i] love it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] you've cracked [the] [nutrition] joke [, turning] [those] lines [of] code into [a] [food] pun . [that's] [one] [way] [to] 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort [of] [food] do [you] _feel_ like ? 
B|13| Human 2: i'd [say] you've [just] seasoned [the] conversation with [a] well-rounded [nutrition] pun ! [that's] [one] [way] [to] [feel] 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . [all] their [food] is green [and] [the] plates [are] green too .
