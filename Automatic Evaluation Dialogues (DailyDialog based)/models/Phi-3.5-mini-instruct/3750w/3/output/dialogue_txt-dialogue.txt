A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey 
A|2| Human 1: is it raining _pretty_ bad today ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm phi , an _ai_ , so _i don't_ _have_ access _to_ real-time data or _weather_ updates . _to_ find out if 
A|4| Human 1: surprising _that_ _the_ _rain_ started _early_ this year ... [i don't] _like_ _them too_ _much_ . _they_ _make_ days gloomy 
B|5| Human 2: i'm phi , and [i don't] _have_ [the] ability _to_ [make] _weather_ predictions or provide current local _weather_ updates . however , [rain] [early] _in_ 
A|6| Human 1: where [i] grew up , we had lots of _water_ _trouble_ _too_ ... 
B|7| Human 2: i'm phi , [the] _ai_ , and [i don't] [make] predictions [like] humans do . _but_ [early] _rains_ _can_ indeed influence [water] systems 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ ... [i don't] think [i] [can] _survive_ [in] _that_ [weather] ever _. just_ _the rains_ at 50 degrees [make] me want [to] sit [in] heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: [just] [like] [the rains] can't [make] [the] [weather] , [i don't] _have_ [the] power [to] [survive] [them too] ! [they] may cause [trouble] , 
A|10| Human 1: _people_ say there is drought _here_ ... [but] we [have] _24 hours water supply_ _here_ ... lol ... never seen _that_ [in] _a_ drought ridden area 
B|11| Human 2: [haha] , that's _interesting_ ! [24 hours water supply] must [make] [the] rounds [here] [. just] [like] [people] [have] various coping mechanisms 
A|12| Human 1: hmm .... okay . _climate change_ talk this morning was _pretty_ darn [interesting] . did you see it ? 
B|13| Human 2: [climate change] [can] [have] [pretty] significant impacts on [weather] patterns , [water supply] , agriculture , and [much] more . it's [a] complex issue [that] 
A|14| Human 1: [they] were talking about how [ai] is helping [climate change] . nice use of upcoming tech .
