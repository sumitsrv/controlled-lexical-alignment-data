A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn how _to_ _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _that's_ _a_ wonderful culinary adventure ! making [croissants] _is_ an art _that_ requires patience _and_ precision . _it_ involves _a_ technique called 
A|4| Human 1: i've done them once _or_ twice _so_ far _, but_ _they haven't been flakey_ enough . _i'm_ _trying to_ _figure out why_ . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] an ai , [so] _i_ _don't_ [make] [cookies] [, but] _i_ am here [to] help [you] [figure out why] your [croissants] haven 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [it's great] _that_ you're [trying to] help [out] . _i_ suspect _a_ few potential reasons [why] [they haven't been flakey] enough:

A|10| Human 1: some people [don't] ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , [i] think i'd eat _pastries_ _all_ _the_ time if [i] _could_ get away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [all] ears [with] [the] [pastries] [too] ! [now] [to] [give] [you] [a] little technical advice: 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention _to that sort of_ stuff was _when_ <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [all] ears [too] [when] [it] comes [to that sort of] [sweet] [and] technical information . [the] butter [you] choose [could] certainly [have] an impact . 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
