Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	I understand that many people face challenges and negative experiences. If you ever want to talk about feelings or need support, know that I'm here
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.

Human 2:	I grew up with the constant hum and buzzing of electricity through much of my youth. It's not about empathy shaping
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	It's not about the person or organisation owing money. What you're referring to now might have been an idiomatic expression used to
