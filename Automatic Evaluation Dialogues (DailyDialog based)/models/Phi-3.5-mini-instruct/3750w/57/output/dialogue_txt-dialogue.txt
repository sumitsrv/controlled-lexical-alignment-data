B|3| Human 2: hello ! as an ai _, i_ _don't_ experience days , but i'm here _and_ fully operational for [your] quick [day] as well . 
A|4| Human 1: oh [, i] _would love to_ twiddle _my_ thumbs . _you're_ so lucky ! today , i've been mostly attending _meetings , reading_ _and writing docs_ _, reading papers_ etc . 
B|5| Human 2: i'm glad [to] _be_ here [and] assist _you_ ! managing [meetings [, reading] papers] _, [and_ writing docs] sounds productive [. how] _can_ [i] help 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! [i] sometimes _drift off during work_ [, and] _see_ similar _things_ _in_ _my_ head . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [see] [your] point [and] [would love to] help [drift off during work] if [things] ever get _too_ intense . you've got [my] attention 2

A|12| Human 1: [i] _just_ met someone who went _diving_ _in_ australia . apparently , [you] _cannot_ fly 24 hrs after [you] _dive_ , because [your] _body_ accumulates [too] much <redacted_term> _when_ _breathing_ [with] a cylinder so , [don't] do _that_ ! 
B|13| Human 2: _it's_ important [to] clarify [that] [diving] [with] [breathing] gases [and] [flying] afterward [cannot] [be] directly related [in] [the] metaphor [you] [just] provided 
A|14| Human 1: that's equally _amazing_ ! [i] wish [i] [can] explore _such_ _places_ _one_ [day] . [it's] [just] so expensive 
B|15| Human 2: [it's] indeed [one] of [the] [amazing] [places] [with] [such] unique [diving] conditions [that] [can] teach [you] [about] marine conservation [and] [body] physiology [when] breath 
A|16| Human 1: woah !... [you] know _sharing_ is caring . [you] should _share_ [that] _money_ _with me_ :) 
B|17| Human 2: [it's] great [that] [you're] [sharing] [such] information [with me] ! while [i] can't [share] [money] or [dive] myself , i'm here 
A|18| Human 1: [you] are a kind soul !
