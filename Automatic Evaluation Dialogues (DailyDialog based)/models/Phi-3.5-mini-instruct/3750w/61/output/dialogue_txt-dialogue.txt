A|6| Human 1: _what_ _do_ _you do_ [to] _unwind_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: since _i_ [do] not [unwind] [the] way humans [and] [pikachu] [do] , [you] might say [my] time [is] spent optimizing data , refining algorithms 
A|8| Human 1: oddly enough [, i] also _catch_ _pokémon_ _on_ [my] phone . [i] used [to] [do] it more [, but] it _just never ends_ . [i] used [to] [do] it _everyday_ . now [i] mostly _catch_ _them_ _when_ [i] _travel_ somewhere _exotic_ . 
B|9| Human 2: that's quite [the] [exotic] [catch] ! [pokémon] [travel] [just never ends] [when] [you] [are] [ready] [and] equipped [to] explore [everyday] [life] . [what] 
A|10| Human 1: [in] [the] game [, _i] use_ vaporeon [a] lot _. _but_ i_ think [pikachu] [is] [the] cutest , that’s why [i] changed [my] [name] [to] match . lately [, i] think _baby yoda_ [is] [the] cutest though . _have you seen baby yoda ?_

A|12| Human 1: [what] [is] [your] favorite _show_ [to] _watch_ right now ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] don't [watch] shows [the] traditional way [you do] [, [but] [i] use] [them] [to] train [and] improve [my] algorithms [. but] if [i] had [to] choose , 
A|14| Human 1: [i] was _watching_ _cat_ _rescue_ _videos_ _on_ youtube [a] lot . there sure [are] [a] lot of _stray cat babies_ _that_ get stuck [in] pipes [and] gutters [in] south korea . 
B|15| Human 2: that's quite [the] [rescue] operation [you] [are] [watching] ! if [your] algorithms learned from [show] [videos] [and] [stray cat babies] , [that] must be [a] 
A|16| Human 1: [do] [you] _like_ cats _or_ dogs better ? [do] [you] [have] _any_ _pets_ ? 
B|17| Human 2: [i] don't [have] [pets] [or] [any] preferences [like] [that] [. but] if [i] were [to] simulate [the] experience [and] choose based [on] [the] data available [to]
