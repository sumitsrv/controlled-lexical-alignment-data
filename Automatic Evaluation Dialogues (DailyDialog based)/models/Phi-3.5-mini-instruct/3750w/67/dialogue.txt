Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	That's incredibly exciting! I'm here for any questions or tips you might need before you jump! What specifically would you like to
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Seville sounds fantastic for skydiving! Spain's varied landscapes provide great jumping locations near home. I can help you research
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	I'm feeling ready for an intense leap of faith! Yes, you have done skydiving before and I've heard great things
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	I'm getting ready for skydiving 150ft before you share any more advice, thanks! Have a great experience!<|end|><|assistant|>
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	I'm all for that extreme sports feeling! 150ft is definitely going fast, especially if you're ready to dive into
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	That's the spirit! 150ft and skiing down that slope you conquered definitely make for some adrenaline-p
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
