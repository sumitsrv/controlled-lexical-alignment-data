Human 2:	Kind of! Biology, neuroscience, and medicine all intertwine closely in brain surgeon training. 
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I can't practice brain surgeries, but you can definitely pursue the knowledge and skills that are necessary for this career. 
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	Not at all! While you're born with your brain that's wired one way, skills can be learned and honed.
