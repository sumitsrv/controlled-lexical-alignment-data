A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i'm_ phi , an ai language model , _so_ _i_ don't [have] _personal_ _preferences_ , feelings , or favorites . however , 
A|4| Human 1: [i'm] _working on_ _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ _spring_ to _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [the lotus] [flower] (nelumbo nucifera) _is_ [a] powerful symbol in several cultures _and_ [the] [spring] [mind] you're [working on] 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ [a] [personal] theory . [i] think that [flower] [preferences] _are_ _more_ revealing of _personality_ than people _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] phi , _it_ might [not] [have] [personal] [preferences] , but [i] can [appreciate] [the lotus] flower's symbolism ! 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _gerbera_ _. it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] _then_ [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [not] [a] _person_ [with] [personal] [preferences] [like] [you] might [have] . however , [gerbera] flowers [are] indeed known for _their_ v 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ _what_ [their] favourite [flower] [is] . pretty much [like] _what_ we _just_ _did_ . does that _make_ sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [not] [someone] [with] [personal] [preferences] [like] [you] [did] [just] now . [just] [make] [it] [more] [flower] _talk_ [then] [. it's] [what] 
A|12| Human 1: cool _. step_ 2: [talk] [with] [the] [person] some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] _gradually develop_ [a] sense of [what] they're [like] , _over_ [the] course of maybe _two_ to five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] phi [and] [not] [someone] [with] [personal] [preferences] [like] [you] [did] [just] now [. step] 3: [gradually develop] [the] [personality] [over] [two] [years]
