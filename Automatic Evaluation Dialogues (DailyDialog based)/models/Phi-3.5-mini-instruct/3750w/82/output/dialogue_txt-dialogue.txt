B|1| Human 2: yo ! _what_ brought _you_ here 
A|2| Human 1: _just_ looking _to chat_ . yourself ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an ai digital assistant here [to chat] with _you_ . what's _on_ _your_ mind today ? <|end|><|assistant|> [just] 
A|4| Human 1: _i am_ [just] _enjoying_ a _cigar_ at _the_ moment . how _about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i] don't experience sensations , so [i] don't engage _in_ activities like [enjoying] [cigar] smoke _, but_ [i am] fully operational 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ is _actually_ _from peru_ , _which_ is _more_ my taste . smoking isn't _very healthy_ [, but] _it's_ _actually quite_ _relaxing_ , _which_ [in] a way is _good for_ [your] health . haha 
B|7| Human 2: [your] statement brings [quite] [the] unique perspective [from] [your] place of origin ! [peru] indeed enjoys [relaxing] pastimes [which] can _be_ [very healthy] [for] one' 
A|8| Human 1: haha "you _only_ live once" _as_ they say ! 
B|9| Human 2: while [it's] true _that_ [one] [only] lives once , [healthy] pastimes [actually quite] [the] contrary [for] [peru] [which] enjoys [relaxing] [but] [very] [good for] 
A|10| Human 1: haha , [that] is _not_ [what] _i was_ getting at [, but] yes [that] _would_ [be] nice . do [you] believe [in] _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: i'm phi , an ai , [not] [from peru] [but] [your] statements [about] _it_ are [quite] interesting ! however , [reincarnation] falls [more] 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] think _neural_ link will _allow_ [you] [to] live after death ? [i] thought [it] _was just_ a brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: apologies [for] [the] confusion . [i [was] just] musing [that] [neural] links could theoretically [allow] thought-based interactions [which] [would] [not] [be] bound by 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] see . [that] is a much harder _task_ , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: [as] phi , [the] ai , [it's] [not] [about] musing [but] interpreting [your] [task] . theoretical [neural] links [would] [allow] 
A|16| Human 1: depends [on] how [good] [the] brain dump is [i] suppose ...
