A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ _about_ _human like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! i'm phi , an _ai_ language model . _i think_ [human like chat _bots] are_ fascinating examples _of_ _the_ intersection between 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have_ made _some_ _great_ _progress_ over last few years . do _you_ [think] _the positives_ _outweigh_ [the] _negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: it’s [great] [to] [chat] [about] [progress] ! _as_ for [the positives] outweighing negatives: 
A|6| Human 1: [like] _impersorsination_ ? though it _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: indeed , [impersorsination] [sounds] [like] _a_ progressive term in [the] realm _of_ human-like [chat bots] . here's [some] [positives] 
A|8| Human 1: _true that_ _! some_ [of] _these_ [bots are] very engaging _and_ funny . _they are_ now good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how_ _far_ [are] _we_ _from_ [the] time _these_ [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] getting sophisticated [and] human-like in [how] [they] engage _with_ users [! some] [even] [have] [the] ability [to] learn [from] interactions [that] could 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it _can_ take _many_ different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication is _also_ huge ! it will signify [how] [ai] research _has_ progressed so _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] _stepping_ on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ be overselling it _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: absolutely , [the] [progress] [has] been [stepping] stones [and] [here] [are] [some] [positives] [that] [might] [even] [far] [outweigh] [negatives] [from] [these] [ai] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current auto-suggestions_ _already_ do _pretty_ good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true that] [the current auto-suggestions] [and] [many] [ai] chatbots [already] [can] engage [more] [like] humans [and] [even] anticipate [some] needs ! 
A|14| Human 1: haha , _pretty_ [far] fetched 🙂 nice _having_ _this_ _conversation_ [with] _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: it's [pretty] interesting [how] [we] [can] bounce [these] thoughts off each other 😄 [the] [conversation] [you] [are] [having] [with] [this] [ai] [also]
