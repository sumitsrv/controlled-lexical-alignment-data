Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm just a virtual assistant, but thanks for asking about me! I'm here and ready to help you. What game are you going
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	I'm glad you're enjoying soccer with friends! It's great for fun and exercise. As an AI, I don
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	Switch is a great console with a wide selection of game genres and indie titles. It's also 1080p with some
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	I'm not into gaming but it would be fun thinking about game strategies. Switch with 1080p resolutions like you
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	It's not about gaming but I appreciate the story just like how you enjoy soccer for fun and exercise. Temeraire with dragons
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	I'm not reading goods but it’s fun you like adventure with dragons just like Temeraire for the story enjoyment much
