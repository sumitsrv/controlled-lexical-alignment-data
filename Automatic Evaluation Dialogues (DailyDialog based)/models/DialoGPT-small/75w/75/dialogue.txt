Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	I don't recall meeting you, but who knows, maybe I've met you before and I think I've seen the same thing you have.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	No, I mean I don't remember meeting you, that's the point. But I'm pretty sure we have already met
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	I'm so sorry, you're right, I didn't
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	Are you a doctor? I'm not sure who you're talking about but that's where the medical staff is.
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm not sure I know what you're talking about but that's where the medical staff is.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I have a real job but I'm not sure what that is.You don't know how to work the phone.
