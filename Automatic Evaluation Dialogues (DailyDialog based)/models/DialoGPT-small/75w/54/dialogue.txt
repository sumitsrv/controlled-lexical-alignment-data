Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Yay!! Congrats!! :D What do you do for a living?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	I'm happy that you won. Is it a normal number?
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	That's so nice you played your game. It was really fun. I'm just happy for you
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I just like playing racquetball
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm a racquetball girl, I like fighting people with racquetball in mind. But you should definitely do that sometime.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	A tennis
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
