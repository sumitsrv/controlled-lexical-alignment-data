Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'll be at work in 30. Can't wait for Monday.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	No and I don't work this weekend so that's the day. How about that moped though...
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I would like the mechanic to check that out and see if he's trying to repair it or not.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'm getting to work?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	You should
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I don't think you can deny that
