A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far , but they haven't been _flakey enough_ . i'm trying [to] figure out why . what kind of cookies _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: do _you have_ [them] [flakey enough] [to make] your [croissants] ? it'd be _good_ [to] _try_ . 
A|6| Human 1: ah , [good] thought , thanks !

A|8| Human 1: now that is a [good] idea . i'll _give_ [it] a [try] next time . _would_ [you] say [you have] a sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: cute

B|11| Human 2: [would] [it] be [too] much [to] ask [you] [to] [eat] [all the] [pastries] [i] [give] [you] ? 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] that sort of stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as a fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: you're welcome ! 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
