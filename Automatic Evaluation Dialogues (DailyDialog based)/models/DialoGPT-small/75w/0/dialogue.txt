Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	What was your favorite country to live in?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	How would you define what people think? The interactions are what's interesting, short and it's all really personal
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	Oh okay, how did you get asked?
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	No, we are talking about what people think is interesting and what they think is spooky.
