Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 nice meeting you. what are you up to?
Human 2:	Hello and welcome to the group!
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	Well, food is for losers, I don't eat any.
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	Yup. Japanese food is just for the Japanese. If you like Chinese food you have to know what it is. It doesn't matter what it
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	I'll have you know, I go for the best Japanese food.
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	I live near the border..
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	They definitely do have better food, though the fish are soft.
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
