Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	I have a birthday, I do that for fun!
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	Yes, it's really cold this time of year, and the sun is very interesting.
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	Youre cool.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	I live in the area? We are you are you going this year?
