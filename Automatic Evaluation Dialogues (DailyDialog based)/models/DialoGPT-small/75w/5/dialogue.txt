Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	You know what I miss the most?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	I can help with that. I'm going to head over to her house and try to find your catfood dish.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I could go anywhere i want, what could you do in return?
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	I could go to zipline
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	I'm just kidding.That sounds scary and cool.It could be a nice thing.You could make some money.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	Yeah i can't imagine that would cost too much to make, and i won't need all that much money
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	I'm just trying to make a living and drink and zipline.
