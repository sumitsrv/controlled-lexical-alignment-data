A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect _back_ _too_ _much_ on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have_ been very favorable _for_ me in terms of time spent _with_ _family_ _and_ _friends and_ work life balance . why _do you_ ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [have] [too] many [friends and] [family] , _how_ were [you] [with] them _so_ [much] before [you] came [back] _for the_ holidays ? 
A|4| Human 1: great ! _good_ idea to help people figuring out their _new year_ resolutions 🙂 [so] _how do_ [i] get a fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: welcome [back] [and] [good] luck [with] your [new year] !

B|9| Human 2: [how [do] you] [do] _it_ [with this] [mental health] ? 
A|10| Human 1: that is actually a quote stolen from my tl when [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs of work experience , [i] fully agree [with] [it] 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: hahaa [this] makes [the] [new year] even better . thanks 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] think [family] [and] [friends] play a big role here . 2 . meaningful work life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies that keep [you] busy ... [so] on 🙂 [what] about _you ?_ is there a right answer to [this] ? :)
