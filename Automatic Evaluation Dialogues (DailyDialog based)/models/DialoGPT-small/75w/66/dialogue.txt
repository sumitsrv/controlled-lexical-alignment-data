Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I do. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I've already started training for events this year... I've only just begun the summer for my summer marathon, but I can't wait!
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	What race are you doing and for which reason?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	Do you like doing obstacle races for fun? How long
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I'm in California next year.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	2 months for me! It's great time for a new game to come out.
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I'm in socal for the next one. I'm on a mission trip.
