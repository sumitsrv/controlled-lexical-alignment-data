Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	I'm in a band, I'll talk to you later.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Which town if you don't mind?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Well I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Hey I like sports as well!
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Thanks, I'll check that out as well. I've been skiing for a long time but I'm afraid of getting tired of it.Like you
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Ski
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
