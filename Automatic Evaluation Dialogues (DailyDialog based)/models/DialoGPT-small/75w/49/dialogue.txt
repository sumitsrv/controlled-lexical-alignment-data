Human 2:	So you guys will be watching UFC 209 live? haha That'd do it.
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm so hyped.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Hahahaha that might be fun. That's awesome
