Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	I live around there too. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	That's what I was thinking. But I will go back home and get that to myself. How about you?
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	Ok well we'll see if there is anything interesting that I can do soon
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	I haven't really been out much lately but if you are on the east coast, I have plenty of places to go.
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	Cool I am in San Francisco. Where are you located?
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	No. In the house we are. It's been raining cats and dogs here since 2.30.
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
