Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	walks in, takes lunch, sits in corner, waits for this thread with my day
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	I just had a hard time thinking of that day in general.But i feel like it's something like you didn't do fine on history test.
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	So the Civil War wasn't a thing that happened? Why do people still believe history was written by slaves?
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	I think you're forgetting about the Civil War
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I see... you know?
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	Oh wow you did not know the whole horse was turned into a horse?
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	No. Sorry it took me so long. My job is horse handling. And you?
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	That sounds amazing. That makes me very happy to know you like horse handling. I'm not sure what it would be for a job though
