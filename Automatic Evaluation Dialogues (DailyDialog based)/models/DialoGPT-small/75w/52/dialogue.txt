Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	If they are giving out some goodies...
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Does the jacket have any goodies in it?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	You seem pretty good, but what about that beautiful cold weather? I guess it doesn't make much difference since our dogs already hate each other
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Nah, I live in Florida. I can't even walk for 3 hours!
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Where in New York, OP?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Oh right! I should get out there and see the place they have
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	I think your desk might get lost and you need to take a walk out there.
