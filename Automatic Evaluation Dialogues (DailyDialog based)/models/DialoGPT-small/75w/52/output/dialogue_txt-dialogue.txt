A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , how _are_ _you_ doing today ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ heard _they are giving out some _goodies_ in_ microkitchen . 
B|3| Human 2: if [they are giving out some goodies] ... 
A|4| Human 1: _i guess_ its _a_ _jacket_ ! very _much_ needed _that_ _in_ _the_ _cold_ 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: does [the] [jacket] have any [goodies in] _it_ ? 
A|6| Human 1: sure _hate_ [it] ! limits _our_ ability _to_ go [out] _even_ _for_ _a walk_ ! its _good_ _that_ we don't _get_ _to_ suffer extreme _cold weather_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: _you_ seem pretty [good] , but what about [that] beautiful [cold weather] ? [i guess] [it] doesn't make [much] difference since [our] dogs already [hate] each other 
A|8| Human 1: _oh_ nice ! _where_ did [you] _live_ before ? 
B|9| Human 2: nah _, i_ [live] [in] florida _. i_ can't [even] [walk] [for] 3 hours ! 
A|10| Human 1: _new york_ ! nice ! best _place_ _to_ [live] 🙂 .. _right_ , except [for] [the] [cold] ! 
B|11| Human 2: [where] [in] [new york] , op ? 
A|12| Human 1: anyways [, [i] guess] we _should_ better hurry up _to_ _get_ [the] [goodies] [. i] remember last time [they] ran [out] of [it] . 
B|13| Human 2: [oh] [right] ! [i] [should] [get] [out] _there_ _and_ see [the] [place] [they] have 
A|14| Human 1: [the] one [in] [our] floor [. i] will [get] by _your desk_ [and] we can [walk] _there ._ 
B|15| Human 2: [i] think [your desk] might [get] lost [and] [you] need [to] take [a walk] [out] [there .]
