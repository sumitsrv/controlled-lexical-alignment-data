Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	Hi there! Welcome to the sub! What about you?
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	If you were invisible, I would be the last one to come.
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	I would rather this be done via the machine learning for the first time and not blind people. That way no one can see you
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	Can you see a brain if you can't recognise the brain?
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	I believe in the god that exists for us to perceive it.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	You don't believe in science? You believe what the Science says?
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	If it made sense what I did I would be dead.
