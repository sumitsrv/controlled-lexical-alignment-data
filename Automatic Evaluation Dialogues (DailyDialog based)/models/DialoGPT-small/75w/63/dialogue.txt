Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	I have the same issue and my kids would want to know what I said about Disneyland!!!
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That seems like a solid plan. How do you plan on going from the Disney Parks?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	That sounds great!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yeah.. That sounds good
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	The day before Christmas is not the time for an Airbnb. If that is your plan of attack I'm sure someone will come through!
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	You can't take a lead on that : I'm getting a 20 for
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Yup, you want to be on my lego.com in about 2 months?
