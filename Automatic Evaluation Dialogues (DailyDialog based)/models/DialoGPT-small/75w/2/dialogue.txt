Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	Hello. Hi. I am you.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	It was this past Saturday, I'll probably end up getting the last one sometime this month, so you can look forward to it!
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	It was only the first time it has been going this long!
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Yeah... I recently learned it was in the last few weeks...
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	A lot more time for activities!
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	That is really cool and exciting! I've never had a bull like this on any time since high school... and that is exactly why I have this
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	I hope so... My Saturday was boring, but that's what you want your bull
