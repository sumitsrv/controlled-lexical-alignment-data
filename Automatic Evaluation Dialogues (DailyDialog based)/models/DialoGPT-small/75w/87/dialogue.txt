Human 2:	I'm enjoying the book right now, I think I'm reading it now
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?

Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	What book do you like so good? I'm currently reading the book on how to sleep better.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	I haven't heard of it, what's it about?
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 yup!
