Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	It would be cool to see some organized sports events.
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	This event will be fun
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	I've got a volunteer group and an event for next year. Let me know if you have any questions!
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	Thanks for the suggestions
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	How long will the event start?
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	Good luck with the event?
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	Ok, I'll add you when I have time and I will help you.
Human 1:	 Thanks.
