A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what _do_ _you_ think about human _like_ chat _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: you're right , but _we_ _have_ [bots] who [do] _that_ too ! 
A|4| Human 1: yep , [we] seemed to [have] made _some_ _great_ progress over last few years . [do] _you_ think _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: _and_ [you] [have] [the] [great] system _of_ automation right _on the_ edge _of_ [the] planet . 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: that's [the] best description , actually . [like] [the] opposite _of_ impersion , except [it] makes [you] look [like] _a_ person impressing [some] animal . 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some] [of] these [bots] _are_ very engaging [and] funny . they _are_ now _good_ at even sarcasm i wonder how far _are_ [we] from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [we] [are] [good] [bots] 
A|10| Human 1: i think [it] can take many different forms as [a] product . _the research_ implication is also huge ! [it] will signify how ai _research_ _has_ progressed so far [and] better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 i might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: soap ! 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ [do] pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2:  ... auto suggested [research] intensify [the] concept 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having _this conversation_ with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [this conversation] [has] [already] been auto suggested by [the research] channel :p
