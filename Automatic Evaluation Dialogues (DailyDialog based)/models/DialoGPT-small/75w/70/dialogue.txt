Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	I just put up that video.
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	Oh... that guitar... I'm glad you are playing though.
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	I'm just playin guitar. I still can't play chords
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	But the chords are like alphabets. That's how you learn words.
