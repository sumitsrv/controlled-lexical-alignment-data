Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hiya guys! I'm happy to finally meet someone sober. It's been great having you around. I hope your day goes well.
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	Hey! Happy Friday to you! I got a class tomorrow and I'm going to start working again soon.
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Awesome
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	I get the tea.
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	Tea. I like tea
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	What is a white teacake?
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	White tea? You mean white teas are the best kind of tea. The rest you like are good.
