Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	I'm glad I have this one saved from when I was last at the party.
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	You've gone full Turkey. I like you
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	Haha you don't know that.
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	I got it from a cook book you find in the home
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	I've got turkey from Turkey night, chicken with the rest of the day
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Yea. This was the last time our party was at a place with a full house.
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Nuhoo!
