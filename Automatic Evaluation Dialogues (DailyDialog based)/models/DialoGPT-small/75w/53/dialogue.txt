Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	Yeah. How about you?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	I work, but I'm off to the beach for a couple days. You?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	I'm not really trying to talk like a normal person. I don't really have any fun projects at all.
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	Yup.. well I started just a few days ago as well :D I've been trying though
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	Ah I'm trying not to think :P
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	How far have you run yet? I started just a few days ago and I'm only like 90 of the way to it
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	Yikes! How long have you run so far?
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	How long ago did this happen?
