Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hi i have just added you as friend and just added a new chat group
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I am just enjoying this new chat group. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	Well that's good. What do you normally smoke?
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	You only live twice as long as your previous life.
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	If you lived for more than 7 hours at most, yes.
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	You will live but I believe you can never die.It just means that you will get your life back. The dream!
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	I will try but no way it will work.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
