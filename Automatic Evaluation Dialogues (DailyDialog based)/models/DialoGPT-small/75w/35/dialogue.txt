Human 2:	I'm in high school, I get the results lol
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	Yeah I wanna be a doc, just be like the rest of us haha
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Are the people in the high school working?
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	If you wanna go for the high school experience, that can be pretty good practice
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	I got lucky, was born with some kind of immunity I think.
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	My med school teacher said I was too young and this is why I didn't do that
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
