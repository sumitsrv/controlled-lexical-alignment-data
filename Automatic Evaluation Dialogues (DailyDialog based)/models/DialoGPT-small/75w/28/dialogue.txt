Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	How're you, I always feel tired in the bathroom
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	How about I eat your eggs and hashbrowns and eat a brownie
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I eat one of the things you eat that I eat.
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	I'm so hungry
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I love BRILLIANT
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I like my food like I'm the only one
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
