Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	I'm gonna help you... I need someone to help me though.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	Why are they friends? But I'm not too sure how to feel with their friendship.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	You are they do that.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	Friends alreadys are for.
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	What's the balance, what are the rules?
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm married. I am single... I feel like this is the perfect place for it.
