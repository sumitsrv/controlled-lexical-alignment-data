Human 1:	 I'm good. How are you doing today?
Human 2:	I'm good to go
Human 1:	 I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?
Human 2:	I did that for the first time today as you are flying with me and have a kite, and I'm not really feeling well as well.
Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	I had a great meal this weekend. What was your dinner choice. I had a good steak for lunch and dinner for my daughter last weekend!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?
Human 2:	Nah, I'm going on my honeymoon
Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	Oh wow I read this and it's like you have no idea!! Have fun!
Human 1:	 haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?
Human 2:	You're going on your last fishing holiday with him
Human 1:	 Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?
