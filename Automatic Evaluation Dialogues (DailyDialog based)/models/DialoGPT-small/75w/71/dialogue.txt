Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	A lot of fun, man!
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	I cried my eyes out when I saw this!
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	The whole project is sad and sad for me
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	Sad and sad. So sad that you've lost someone and now you can't find it.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	Ahh no worries. Happy Friday to everyone!!!!!
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	No, I'm sorry. It's all good bro, that's why I'm trying out keto.
