Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	Yup, I'm back. I had a long day today... And your point is well taken. I suppose I should head to bed now,
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	Yes. Yes it's depressing.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	This movie is great. My favorite part.
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Are the movies that great, and very short,? And they all look great.
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	What's the difference between fun and scary? Is that when it's dark out?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	So you?
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Ohh... Ahh not I like Australia too much
