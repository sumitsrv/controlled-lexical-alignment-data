Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	A lot of today
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I don't like them. They make days gloomy.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	That water had to be too much
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	I can't afford them but I want the water to rain. They make me sit in heated rroms too much
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Why don't people have the water there?
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	It was pretty interesting
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
