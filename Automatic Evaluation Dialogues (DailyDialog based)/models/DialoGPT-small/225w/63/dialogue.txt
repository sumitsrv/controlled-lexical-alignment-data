Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	I know the kids and you will be there for sure
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I have family and want to stay for the next 2 weeks but have they been able to drive to Disneyland?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	I will also drive to Disneyland then
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yes... for the trip.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Yes they do not let you use your own room for christmas though.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	We can take this for you but we want the full year old.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	That was for me, not you. I can't take full responsibility that i would not have the legos
