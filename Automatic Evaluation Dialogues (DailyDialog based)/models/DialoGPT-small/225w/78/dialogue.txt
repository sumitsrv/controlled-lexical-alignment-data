Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	You can't be a pastry chef because you want to be an architect.
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I don't want to be a chef. I'm actually a pastry chef
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	Ohh I have the mind powers now
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	Mind
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	I can do that too I mean eating vegetables and have fun
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I have a dance for work that I've been doing for about 20 years lol
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	That's like 90 day cake day for me haha. I make about 5 cakes a day. Very very very nice.
