Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	I'm just a little bit busy.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	he's been busy! How're your day going for you?
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	Hello and welcome again! I have been off work for the past three weeks and see things similar every day.
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	Hey you guys! How about you and the world?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	I'm going to the world, what about you mate?
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	You dive too. Nice!
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	You can't just explore places one day like that, when you dive
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	Can't share that with you
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
