Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I have a feeling that's going down the opposite route in your day then.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	What's the day you broke this down? E : Sorry to tell you so moped...
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	So I took out the oil and now what? The car is going back down and my mechanic trying to figure that out lol. :D
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Thanks.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	That
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I'm not doubting their record but they won't go all the way. That would be hard for me.
