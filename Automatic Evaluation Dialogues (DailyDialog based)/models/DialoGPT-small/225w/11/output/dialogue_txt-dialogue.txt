A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [have] never heard _of_ this [flower] but _i_ will now ! _thank you_ kind sir . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _it_ [does] [have] [the lotus] [flower] , [i'm] assuming this _is_ _what_ [you] call _them_ by [the] way they look 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! just _a personal_ theory _. _i_ think_ that [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ revealing [of] personality _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [have] [the lotus] [flower] _and_ [it's] [a personal] [favourite] [i think] _it_ looks [more] masculine [than] [you] [are] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon _flower ._ as if [you] drew "flower" with [a] crayon [and] then [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [you] [are] [not] [the] [flower] [i] [have] [it] [i] [like] [it] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone [what] their [favourite] [flower] [is] . pretty much [like] [what] we just did . [does] that make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [a] [flower [.] i] [like] [it] . [you] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person some [more] , [and] ask [them] some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [what] you're they [are] [like] 
A|14| Human 1: why [thank you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
