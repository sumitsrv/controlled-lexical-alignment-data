Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	He looks sad too, I'm a bit sad now.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	I'm sad I missed my catfood dish and her name.Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I would be sad I could go anywhere
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	i would have zipline from tree to tree.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	i'm not about that kind of scary sounds, you won't like the sound of it right now
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	The only one you can't make is your own
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	I can zipline you from trees and eat a few beers while you play, you'll be fine.
