Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	you got any room for new people?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Hey just wanted to say hello. Good to see you. How are you today?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	I just found it's your taste in the world, which I very much respect. Thank you from Peru. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	Haha good to know for one of them
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	Well, that was nice.
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	Yeah you will just be dead as far as possible after death was not it's only good feature
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	I just see you live. I think it's just as easy for you not.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
