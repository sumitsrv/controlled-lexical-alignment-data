Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I've never heard of this one.
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	Yes. The last weekend. Last Rotten Tomatoes score.
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	I'm going to guess the Rotten Tomatoes score for The Last Mandalorian.
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	It's Marvel. The last Mandalorian will be great, the Rotten Tomatoes score will probably blow it out of the water.
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	It was the Spiderman. I think it did well and the movies only good.
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	Good to hear about the first movies
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	Loki can and has said
