Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	I would say I'm pretty good.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Where do you all live? I'm in the UK.
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Hey there. I'm you too. Have done it before as well, great stuff.
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Nice work mate, I'm from Spain too and you look super nice! Have done extreme sports in the past too.
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	What are you skiing in? And that is how? Great job!
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Yes and skiing
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
