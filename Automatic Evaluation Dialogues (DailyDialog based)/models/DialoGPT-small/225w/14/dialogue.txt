Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	He's actually sitting on a roller coaster that's how cool you are
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	He's actually the Kingda king, and it was scary
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	I'm not sure you understand the appeal of roller coaster racing
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	Same, and I'm the first one because that was bad haha
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	That's not bad haha glad I did it now that you know
