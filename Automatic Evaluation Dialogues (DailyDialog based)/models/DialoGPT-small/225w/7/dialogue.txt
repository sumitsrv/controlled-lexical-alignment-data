Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm not good with Avatar's art but I enjoyed your film!
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	What movie did you watch that you love the story with the trees?
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	It's the movie

Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	I like food and you know i have some good food
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
