Human 2:	I got my first birthday party last week so I am totally cool with this.
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	No I'm not haha just calling your bunch Turkey.
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	I was just making you feel like you had a turkey in your mouth haha
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	Lol I was there haha, you just got it and it ate soooo well
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Yeah turkey is the big one, Thanksgiving with chicken was always a blast haha
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	We played the lot together!
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Fun was fun.
