Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	It's some of the microkitchen stuff they are giving out for free
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	How much does the jacket that they are giving out?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Yeah it's good for the cold! I don't hate it that much. Its cold so they are giving out our jackets.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Yep, I live in the coldest city that you can travel in a few weeks
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	I live 2hrs outside the cold city! Nice.
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Yeah they just ran out so I guess that's the last time!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	They only had one floor and you can walk out into the place they have it for
