Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	Well, you are thankful for us.
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	I have nothing interesting, you can always ask me.
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	I have plans for this place. It's beautiful. What time is it for you?
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	It's Canada day.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	Oh and work for?
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	My sister was the one that called for this meet
