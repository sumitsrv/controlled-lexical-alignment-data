Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	What holiday do you get to meet different people
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	How many people do you get to keep count of each persons different holidays?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	You think Australia was busy? Or did you get bored of meeting people?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	I think it's fascinating from people who are really into it but usually the interactions are short and what was happening is just one of them.
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	Interesting how the whole conversation was one short and what you just explained.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	Not spooky, you mean it's interesting to get them and what they are. That's the opposite.
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	Spooky treasure hunting is the best, you can get spooky stuff and even interesting stuff with it
