Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hey there's going to a wedding.
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm going to the wedding today. How does that sound!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	Not the wedding day... I'm going to watch it live!
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	I can't live in the sharks and you are right haha
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Yes haha. I like this weekend's UFC
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	Good I'm still training
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	If the UFC is still in and you have not been training that long I might consider this a win
