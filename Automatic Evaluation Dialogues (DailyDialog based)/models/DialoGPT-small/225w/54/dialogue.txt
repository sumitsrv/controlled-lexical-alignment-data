Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hey you! What about you? Pretty cool.
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	I'm surprised I won that game but not for credit. Pretty amazing. I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I'm just going to guess you have won a game I just won?
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Racquetball I like that game
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	A cage match between two animals of the same color, with racquetball being the game, is a perfect
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I just think of it like tennis, really.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
