Human 2:	Hey high school I wanna go to college. Lol
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	I think everyone is different to the other people I'm actually in high school haha
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I can practice my english and that you can do something with this app.It'll be more complicated tho
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	Nope I am born with one though. Not sure how that would work for you
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	I was born with one and now try med school.Thats pretty
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
