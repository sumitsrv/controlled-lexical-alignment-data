Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	Well my morning has been so quiet that the only thing I'm hearing is howling and I am far from your lovely thoughts
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	You have a busy day for a work day I'm going to go with you to bed now... that should be right
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	I have been waiting for the day I'm going to work for a week
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	lol I have been sceptical
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	Saved the literature?
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	I'm like a comic I don't buy the literature.
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	Oh that's not funny to say at all but I'm the opposite haha
