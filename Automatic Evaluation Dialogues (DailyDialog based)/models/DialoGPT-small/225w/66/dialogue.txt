Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	Yes i am planning to. i am a new runner so I want to see as much as possible :D
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Are you planning on doing any sport?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	What's fun in doing marathons and what obstacles?
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I can't get the race but if you have time next year i am looking for someone
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	I can practice 1 1 2 months for the time trial but what about training sessions?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I can practice with you next time
