Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	That doesn't mean it won't happen, I just need someone to help me with it.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	So they are all in the same position right now. I feel like I am their friend
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I hope for now
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A for everyone
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	I have no idea what the balance is. I always say that it's like you are never alone but for now.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	How about a balance of both? I'm never single or single unless it's the right time but always single.
