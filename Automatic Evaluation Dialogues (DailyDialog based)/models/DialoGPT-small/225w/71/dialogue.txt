Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	Ohhhhhhh! Is he alright Bruhhh?!
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	It was a good day. And you!
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	And I'm the only person on the internet who got a project shelved by the end and didn't get anything for it.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	No, that was me. I got someone for you who lost my love.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	No that was my day
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	I'm out, I'm trying some keto. Lol
