A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back too _much_ on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have_ _been_ very favorable _for_ me in terms of time spent _with_ family _and_ friends _and_ _work life balance_ . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _what_ [have] [you] [been] doing _to help_ [with] [and] or [work life balance] _this_ _year_ ?

B|5| Human 2: _what_ [year] [you] [work] [for] ? [good idea to] [get a fresher outlook] !!! 
A|6| Human 1: wow _! sounds_ amazing if we practice _that_ ! _i_ think [the] [idea] _does_ [have] some potential . _how_ did [you] come up [with] [this] [idea] ?
