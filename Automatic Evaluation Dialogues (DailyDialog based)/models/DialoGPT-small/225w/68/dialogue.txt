Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	i did some basic concepts on the last week and was pretty good at them! not all of them were really difficult though
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	the lectures were not easy last week. I was able to understand some concepts with the time. I think this would have helped out.
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	i was going :P
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	you have time.
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
