A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: how _is_ _the_ youtube _video_ creation _going_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm not [going] _to_ make [the] [video] . i'll leave _it_ as _it_ [is] , because _i_ _like_ _it_ , but i'd rather people make _it_ themselves 
A|4| Human 1: whoa ! looking forward [to] listening [to] [it] . _what_ _softewares_ _you_ _use_ _for_ [it] ? 
B|5| Human 2: [hi] , i'll [use] [the] [softewares] [for] _this_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh cool ! _what_ sort of _music_ do _you_ _compose_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: no [music] [is] [for] [you] sir 
A|8| Human 1: nice .... _you are a_ rockstar ! 😉 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [use] [music] [to] [compose] and [you are a] rocker ? _i_ _like_ that 
A|10| Human 1: yeah .... [i] _play_ bit of _guitar_ . just got my first monitor [this] week 
B|11| Human 2: [you] [play] [guitar] ? [what] [are] [you] doing [this] weekend ? 
A|12| Human 1: yes , [the] bar _chords_ [are] [the] worst . [it] took me _several_ _months_ [to] [play] them well . [i] still _can't_ [play] them [for] [a] long time though 
B|13| Human 2: did [you] [play] [the] [chords] [for] [months] on [several] days ? that [can't] be right 
A|14| Human 1: that's true . it's [like] [the] _alphabets_ in [a] language . once [you] _know_ them , [you] _can_ pretty much write word 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [know] [alphabets] but [can]
