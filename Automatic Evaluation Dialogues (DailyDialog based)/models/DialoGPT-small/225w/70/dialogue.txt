Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	I'm not going to make the video. I'll leave it as it is, because I like it, but I'd rather people make it themselves
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	Hi, I'll use the softewares for this
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	No music is for you sir
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	I use music to compose and you are a rocker? I like that
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	You play guitar? What are you doing this weekend?
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	Did you play the chords for months on several days? That can't be right
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	I know alphabets but can
