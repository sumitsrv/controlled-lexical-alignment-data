Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	I have plans for the holidays. We can talk whenever you guys are free.
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	Well for the family you have Christmas and work on holidays. What will the new home come with?
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	I see. How come you are doing well?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	Why have you been not living? Uganda is only the home of the family for Africa.
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	Where have you traveled? Uganda?
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	Are the volunteer projects not free for all?!!?!
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	Germany Germany : IJGD
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
