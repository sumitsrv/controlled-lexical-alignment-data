A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you think about_ human _like_ _chat_ _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ there's [like] [bots] , _that_ [you] _can_ create [chat] _with_ , i'm not sure exactly _how_ _they_ work tho 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ made _some_ _great_ progress over last few years . do _you think _the_ positives_ _outweigh _the_ negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _so_ [you think [the] negatives] [outweigh [the] positives] , or something ? 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [you think about] [the] negative effect _it can_ [have] ? [like] impersion [sounds] [like] [some] type _of_ [great] or awesome . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that !_ [some] [of] these [bots] _are_ _very_ engaging and funny . [they] _are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder [how] _far_ _are_ we from [the] time these [bots] start giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [you] [are] [bots] [monologues] . 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it can] _take_ _many_ _different_ forms as _a_ product . [the] research implication is _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ signify [how] ai research has progressed [so] _far_ and better place _to_ tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: yes ! 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: _this_ [will] [have] [many] [bots] auto comments . 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty _far_ fetched 🙂 nice having _this conversation_ [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [will] not go [to] [far] off [that !] [the current] autosuggestions [also] [take] [this conversation] [a] [very] [different] direction [haha]
