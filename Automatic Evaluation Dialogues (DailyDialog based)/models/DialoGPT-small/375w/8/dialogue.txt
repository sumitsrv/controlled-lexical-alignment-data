Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	I'm back home and I'm tired! How about you?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	Goodbye I'm out for the game too. Bye
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	I'm out all your business have I? Bye you'll do the most exciting thing for this year
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I don't have plans
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Hawaii Hawaii
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	I love California beaches Broooooooo you need it for the whole day! I have the big one, but you should get the rest.
