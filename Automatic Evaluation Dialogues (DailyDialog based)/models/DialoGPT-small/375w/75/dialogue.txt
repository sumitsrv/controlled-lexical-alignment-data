Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	I met you the day before today's meeting?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	He's the one that made you dance
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Oh, you were the one who made me dance. Lol. I don't remember.
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	You have a private practice you are doing. It's pretty good, I'm gonna start one tomorrow. You don't have the time but you can
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	I'm not sure what I'm doing that you are doing. You have no practice at all, what you're doing it for is very private
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	lol,
