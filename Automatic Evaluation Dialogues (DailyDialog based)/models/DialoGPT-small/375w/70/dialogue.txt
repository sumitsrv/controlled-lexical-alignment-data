Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	Awesome music. What are you going to play? Just got my first monitor this week. Thanks for sharing.
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	So you can play them for the bar chords right
