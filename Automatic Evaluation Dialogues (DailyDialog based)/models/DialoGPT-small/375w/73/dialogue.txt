Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'll be going to your day
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	That's good I'm tired so I should probably go to your day care to make it more manageable
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	Good idea I'm going to watch some basketball!
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	The Grizzlies
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	Makes the names more exciting! I'm naming my team NeurIPS!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	It's just the name! Haha I'd like that!
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	It's an I that's been replaced with more letters
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I've heard that this movie was called Wallhe. It was scary.
