Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	Morning! Just went to the park and watched The Flash's new episode with my new girl. It's good to see you, too!
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Hi, I'm the beach season all day.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	Hey, look at that beach season!
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	I work near the water.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	I have never even heard of the work you described. I do work near water though, but that's pretty interesting.
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	I'm not the same phenomenon.
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	How are you climbing I'm climbing??
