Human 2:	My home is outside and I ate Turkey, from home. I like turkey. But you did it was funny either way, your comment had me interested
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉

Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	E? you are the home slice?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	we played not fun
