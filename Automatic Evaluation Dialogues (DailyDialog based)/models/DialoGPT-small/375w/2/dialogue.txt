Human 2:	You can tell your friend this was done a really long time ago, the last time you seen this was like, 15 years ago
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	You'd maybe like it a little bit too much...
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	No it's like your opinion. Your friend was the last time you did this. But if you had seen this...
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:
