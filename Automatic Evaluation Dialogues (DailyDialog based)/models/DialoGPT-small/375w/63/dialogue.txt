Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	I know. I was just wanted the kids and the family for Christmas!
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	If Disney and the kids want to join our resort for fun they would have to stay in Disney Springs and Disneyland together.
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Awesome idea!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yeah. Great idea.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	I would think the closed nights can be fun and for christmas eve is a great way to start
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	I don't mind you being your old time self.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	We are you your old time self.Happy b day and take that legos off the shelf please.
