Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	Good to see you back!
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	I got back just after that and I slammed into ice wall, but I'm back now.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	I know that you used ice and high school but I just got back from french class haha I'll see if I can find any cool stuff
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	I know you were going but that was after high school so I'm just going back and seeing things.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	Awesome skating
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	You don't think you can pull just that?
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	Can't you just pull the sides of that to see?
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
