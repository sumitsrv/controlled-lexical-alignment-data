Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	Do you get to meet people in a new town every month?
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	How many people do you get to meet every month? Hard to keep count if I did.
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	Is that the new Australia?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	How are interactions and people from what's usually Australia?
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	How are people from what's usually Australia and you??
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	Yeah it's interesting and spooky. The people are from what is usually Australia but I think they get really into it and their interactions are really unique
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	We usually do spooky treasure hunting in Australia but I can often get it done in Australia
