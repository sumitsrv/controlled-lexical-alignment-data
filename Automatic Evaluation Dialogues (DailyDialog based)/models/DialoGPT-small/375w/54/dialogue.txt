Human 2:	I'm just about done. I won the contest but you should give it to that game for your favorite game!
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Yeah I'm like that with racquetball game.
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	Yes I'm that's how racquetball get physical with like 10 men
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
