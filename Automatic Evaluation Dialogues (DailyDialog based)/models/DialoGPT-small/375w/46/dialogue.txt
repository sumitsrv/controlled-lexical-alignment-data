Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	I help if I need someone for a scenario. Not necessarily for you though.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	I like the other person's friend. Do they have a lot of friends right now too because their friendship is so sad...
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I hope
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A from everyone That's for all though
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	How often do the people say they feel all of that balance what's
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	What's the balance? I hope it's like that because I'm single.
