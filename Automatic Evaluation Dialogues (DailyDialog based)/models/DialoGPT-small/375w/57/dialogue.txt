Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	I don't know, but I do have a lot of flying by today : 3
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	I love it I've been doing mostly writing and reading papers for my day :p
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	I twiddle my thumbs sometimes and I'm reading
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	What are you doing?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	I would but I've been going all places this summer and the summer break is about to be over. How about you?
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	Might wanna just dive the same places when
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	Yay! It's amazing
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	You should share too I think that's amazing! You can?
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
