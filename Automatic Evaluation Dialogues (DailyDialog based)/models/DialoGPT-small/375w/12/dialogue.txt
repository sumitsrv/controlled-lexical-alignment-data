Human 1:	 It's good it's good. How are you?
Human 2:	I know it's not you... How are you?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where do you live?
Human 2:	Hello and it's nice to meet you.
Human 1:	 Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....
Human 2:	Oh nice Japan, where you live?
Human 1:	 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!
Human 2:	Hello, Japan! I've been there so long you might think I was the hot sister
Human 1:	 Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
Human 2:	Hello I went on the Tokyo show and was in Japan during it. It was nice.
Human 1:	 The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!
Human 2:	I went on Disney land the other day and was in Japan for all the shows. It's nice.
Human 1:	 I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha
Human 2:	C'm I was awesome
