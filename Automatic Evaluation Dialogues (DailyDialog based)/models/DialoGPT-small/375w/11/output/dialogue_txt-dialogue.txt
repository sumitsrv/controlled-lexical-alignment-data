B|3| Human 2: _it's_ [a] _flower ._ there _is_ no [you] . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on [a] _theory_ . _why_ does _the_ _lotus_ spring to _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [you have] [the] [mind] _of_ [a] [lotus] [flower] !! 
A|6| Human 1: _oh_ , [it's] _not research_ ! _just_ [a] _personal_ _theory_ _. i think_ that [flower] _preferences_ _are_ _more_ revealing [of] personality _than people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [why] [are] [you] [not research] _it_ [. i think] _that's_ [more] [than people] [think] . [you] can't [have] [personal] [preferences] . [just] [mind] [theory] , but there's 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower .] as if [you] drew "flower" with [a] crayon _and_ then [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [oh] [and] [i] [like] [flower .] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone _what_ their favourite [flower] [is] . pretty much _like what_ we [just] did . does that make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [a] [just] [you] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] _what_ they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [like what] 
A|14| Human 1: [why] thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
