Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	How you been, dude?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	A couple projects that have the break?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	That's the fun part. Haha! You have any plans for the break?
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	Yeah I've been trying for like 2 years lol not that long miles just a couple days
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	Yay I have to run for like 2 miles haha just started
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	Oh I like that. You should do long distances haha
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	I have long distances running marathons on one half of my runathon year. I like this idea
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	Yes but this was one month ago
