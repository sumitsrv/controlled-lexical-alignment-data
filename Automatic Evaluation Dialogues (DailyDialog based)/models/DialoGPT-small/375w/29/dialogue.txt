Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	It's cool. I'm working part time, that's the best.
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Oh that sounds cool. I work sewing from time to time!
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	I drink :D
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I'm tea? I'm you? sewing?
