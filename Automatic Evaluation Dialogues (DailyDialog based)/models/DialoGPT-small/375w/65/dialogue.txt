Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	You are going to love the new day.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	If you don't have the money down your moped broke and you need more than a day
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	Take the diesel out and then put this in the moped so that you have a day lol
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	We should have good time monday
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	I think that should work
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I think my faith should be able to hold it, but the Warriors game would be hard to refute
