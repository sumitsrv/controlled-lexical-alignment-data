Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I run every day of the week, I marathon once a week.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'll see you there! My time is coming up at the start of August, and then I will start working the beginning of September
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	I like the idea but not sure which race you'll be doing and what's the obstacle course.
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	It'd be awesome for you to race next month. What's the time?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	I can workout you for next month or the 1 month? Wanna sign up?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Great, the training ground you can practice for next month is good
