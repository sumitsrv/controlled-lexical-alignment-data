Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	Oh okay, I'm glad you're okay!
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	oh okay, I've been going for two hours and reading your other stuff. You're so lucky! How are you doing today?
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	No, I work and sometimes drift
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	Hey you. How is the world and your day going?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	Hey it's you I see all the places I should go from
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	Maby you don't fly much and that your body accumulates the cylinder too much...
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	How about
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	I can share with you
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
