Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Is anyone out there giving out the goodies? I want some...
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	So that's the coat I heard they are giving out
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	They've already taken the cold out for this weather!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	I live in the UK, they don't have good weather for walk and go though lol
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	I live right there too! Nice place for the walk too, you don't get sun tho that's cold
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	It should be out now the last time I checked they were out for a little
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	What floor?
