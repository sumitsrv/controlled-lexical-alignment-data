Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	What was it like in Australia when all the people where getting on one day?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	How was it? It's really fascinating and people are usually from different countrys or regions. Is this where they learn what matters to them?
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
