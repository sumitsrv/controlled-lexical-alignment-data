Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	Why you think google will let these events next week?
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	I like the tournament idea and everything, i will have you some details on logistics for next week if there is one.
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	I will have some details for the next event as well
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	im theminton.
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	What time will
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	Can you help with the event?
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
