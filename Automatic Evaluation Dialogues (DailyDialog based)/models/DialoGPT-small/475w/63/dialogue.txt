Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Oh yeah, the kids and you wanted to join for the trip.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I think you have the plan for Christmas and then the trip
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	I will do the same and you drive for Disney resort.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yeah, that is fun idea.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	I think they would work the same way but you drive for Disney resort and then have a fun trip on christmas eve
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	you are welcome for this old friend...
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	I can take all your legos.It would be about time for that. What year are you getting this year?
