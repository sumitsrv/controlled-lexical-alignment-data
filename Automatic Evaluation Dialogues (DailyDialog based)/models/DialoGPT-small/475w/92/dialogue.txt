Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	Hahaahhaha, sounds like you work the beach season hahahaha.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	ahhaha very interesting. :D hah sounds like work : Haha have the beach season
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	ahhhahaahaha very dangerous hahavah. Hmmm have the mountain
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	hahaha I am the mountain climbing... like mountain and yes. Haha hah you climb! hah, but.
