Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 nice meeting you. what are you up to?
Human 2:	Hi! Welcome to my world.
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	I ate food for the past two days, it's good here. It's a nice change of pace from craving food.
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	I know what you mean. I only eat Japanese food for the same reason.
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	Yeah, and Parlor has the best Ramen for Japanese food.
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	I live near San Mateo and the best Ramen restaurants here are for sure
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	Yes when the softshell crabs have better food and not those softshells like other places.
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
