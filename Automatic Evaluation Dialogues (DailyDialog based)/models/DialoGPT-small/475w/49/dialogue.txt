Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I don't have a day
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'll try. No weekend though.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	Well, I live in the UK so I'm going to watch it on netflix or whatever, but you can't even see her until the weekend
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	So what is the best way you can watch Hokey?
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Is this the UFC
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm still in the tournament!
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	You win the try but I still consider that an achievement and will give myself a pass this year.
