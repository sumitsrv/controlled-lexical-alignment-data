Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Yeah but you'll be doing marathons next year. Its not fun for the rest of the summer, just like the
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	What's the time next training practice for you?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	How's the training time going
