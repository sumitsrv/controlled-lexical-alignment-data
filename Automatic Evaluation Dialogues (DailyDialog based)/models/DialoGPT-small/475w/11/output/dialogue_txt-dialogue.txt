A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ have a favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _the_ _flower is_ too small . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ a theory . why does [the] _lotus_ spring _to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: yes [i'm] [the] [you] know _what_ _is_ right [lotus] [flower] 
A|6| Human 1: _oh_ , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ a personal theory . _i think_ _that flower_ preferences _are_ more revealing of personality than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [oh] [i'm working on] _it_ , [i think] [you] [are] [not] [the] right [flower] [to mind] [that flower] tho ... 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's_ _like_ a cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" with a crayon _and then_ [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [you] [are] [not] [the] [flower] [i think] [you] [like] [that] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone [what] their favourite [flower is] . pretty much [like] [what] we _just_ did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [it's] [just] [you] [and then] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person some more , [and] ask them some more questions , [and] gradually develop a sense of [what] they're [like] , _over_ [the] course of maybe two [to] _five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [is] [the] [flower] , you're [over] [five years] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's a wonderful idea !
