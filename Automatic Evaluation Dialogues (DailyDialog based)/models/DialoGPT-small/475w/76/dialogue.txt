Human 2:	 Hello. Deja Vu.
Human 1:	 what does that mean?
Human 2:	Oh, that's what it does?
Human 1:	 Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?
Human 2:	I get that feeling sometimes
Human 1:	 How do you know so much about this French phrase?
Human 2:	I know the phrase this French event that I just read about here. But is it you get what happens after all? does that mean all of it
Human 1:	 yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.
Human 2:	I see you re read the phrase that happens before so just thought the phrase is pretty much the same
Human 1:	 wdym by word origins here?
Human 2:	You get the feeling of what happens before that word? I thought it was the word origins here
Human 1:	 Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂
Human 2:	Oh you mean today, just thought id let this conversation know that word origins here
Human 1:	 My friend used to tell me this and found it funny - Mosquitos have 47 teeths
