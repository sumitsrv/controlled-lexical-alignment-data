B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ _normally_ _don't_ _reflect back too much_ on things , _but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very favorable for_ me _in terms of time spent with family_ _and_ friends _and_ _work_ _life_ balance . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [you] [don't] [normally] [reflect back too much] [and] [have been very favorable for] [you] [with] [work] [but] _what_ are your [life] expectations [in terms of time spent with family] 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! good _idea_ to help people figuring out their _new_ [year] _resolutions_ 🙂 _so_ _how_ do _i_ get a fresher outlook ? 🙂

A|10| Human 1: _that_ [is] actually a quote stolen [from] my tl when [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs [of] [work] experience , [i] fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [that] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family] [and] friends play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean _exploring_ around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... _so_ on 🙂 [what] _about you ?_ [is] there a right answer to [this] ? :)

A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually not [much] [of] a reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ _reading_ books corrupts original thoughts 🙂
