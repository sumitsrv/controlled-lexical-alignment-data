Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hello. Just wondering if you'd mind answering my questions?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I just got here, How about yourself?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	I just read it, but from the way it's presented it feels very healthy haha
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	Oh wow, it's good haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	You would just reincarnate that you were alive but not the only one? LOL
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	Yeah that's what you think haha You only live once after death not the whole life for sure.
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	Yes, but that would take much more time. That's just what I was
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
