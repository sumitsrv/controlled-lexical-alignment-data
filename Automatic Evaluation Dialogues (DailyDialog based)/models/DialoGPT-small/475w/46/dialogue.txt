Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	Oh I need help alright, I've been pondering it though too, so I think it's a good plan.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	What's the issue with the friend for lunch now?
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	... friends for now
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	What are texts from now?
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	So what's the balance that you like the sound of but never find?
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	A. I'm the single guy that you like but never find for you.
