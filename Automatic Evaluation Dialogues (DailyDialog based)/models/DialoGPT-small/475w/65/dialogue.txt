Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hello day
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I work this morning and the shop I fixed broke down so I'm going to be getting it fixed. How's your day going?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	That's a diesel motor that won't work if the shop wasn't going too fast and you have a lot of gas to fix your engine lol
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	That sounds good
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Yes you fine. Would you do the day btw?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Lol you think they should be able to finish
