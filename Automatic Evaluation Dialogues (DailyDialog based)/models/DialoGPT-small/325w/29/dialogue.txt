Human 2:	Hi, I'm class right now but i need you to be around for two years. My time's great.
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Yay I'm class full time. What class you take?
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	I like tea
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	I feel your favorite tea's tea. you would be potat tea!
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	Yasuo tea?
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	I like your channel! I'm actually playing japanese teas all the time now...
