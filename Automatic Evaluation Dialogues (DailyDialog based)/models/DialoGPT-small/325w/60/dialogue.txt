Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	Oh good, your's is better. It's my day to say Hi. How are you?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	Hello darkness! How was your weekend?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	Yeah It was nice and the movie is good, how about YOU?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Yeah they all look the same and that's good! How about us?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Haha yes I can agree that it's scary when it's dark out but I'm very good about the same over and over.
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	Yeah I was actually!!
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	So like Australia too!
