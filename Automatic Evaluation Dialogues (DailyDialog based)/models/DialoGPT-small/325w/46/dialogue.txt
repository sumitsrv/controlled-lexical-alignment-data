Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	That sounds good. I've been pondering this myself.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	What are you the other person's partner? Are they their friend now?
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I hope for you
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	You are already avoiding everyone? Lol or what
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	What the balance? It's all good I used it though.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	A few friends have used the I'm single but it's never been worked. It just always seems like it's all that I'm good for.
