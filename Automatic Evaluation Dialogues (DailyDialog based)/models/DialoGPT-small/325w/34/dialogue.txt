Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	Hello! Are you here? Please have a Merry Christmas.
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	Hey you! Are you here for thanksgiving??
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	I think the pie with pumpkin is what you need more about.
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	I think the pie would do you more good then Christmas.
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	Yeah and clothes for the discount tag and some electronics for christmas. :P
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	I know you think the price tag for everything that has ever been made and used may scare you.
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
