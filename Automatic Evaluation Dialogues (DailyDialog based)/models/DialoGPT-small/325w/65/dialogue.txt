Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	You have a wonderful day!
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Oh and the way to do this is moped work.
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I now realize that this is the work of a mechanic and not me lol. It's still good though so far.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'm here now!!
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	No problem. I should be home soon.
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I appreciate your faith in the Warriors but you're not good enough to catch their
