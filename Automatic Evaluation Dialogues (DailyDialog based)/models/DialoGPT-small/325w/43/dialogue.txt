Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	Can you provide some context? What kind are you looking for and do you have the mentorship program?
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	Are you the mentor? I got this time to start. I have mentorship.
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	1:1 or 1:4?
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	1:1 mentor mentee 1 time you started or you plan to start.
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	1:1 mentor 1 time you were working with, been working with you this cycle.
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
