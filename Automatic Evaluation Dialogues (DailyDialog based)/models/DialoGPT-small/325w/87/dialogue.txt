Human 2:	He waves and the book comes back over and you are enjoying some coffee
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	It's like sleep paralysis you have a good book that does it but how it's better than the book in question.
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	What book are you reading?
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	How about the book? it's like sleep paralysis but for startups
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 yup!
