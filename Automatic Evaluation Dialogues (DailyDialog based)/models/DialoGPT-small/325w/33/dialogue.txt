Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Hello croissant. I'm hungry. It's great how you make me look that pale and pale.
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	I'm kind of hungry now. I made croissants but they haven't been flakey enough. why's that?
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	Oh good I'm
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	Yes you
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I thought you could get away with all the good time eaters. I'm curious
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	Mmmm... the fat
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
