Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hi I'm Tom and I love it here
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Hi Tom and just enjoying the city! How about you?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	I see it's Peru the more I see you from your name. You're a good man.
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	I only say it once actually haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	I believe that would be nice
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	I believe it would you need to think in your brain after death but not actually believe in reincarnation for it to work at all.
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	honestly, brain is much more important than just the one you think it was,
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
