Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Nice to meet you too. How's it going?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	I put money down with this money! You are so great! How's everyone going?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	I'm going deep sea fishing with some friends! Criiii
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	I'm going deep sea fishing this weekend
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Yes you can, It's very fun over there but its nice once in a while since I always have friends. In the sea.
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	Ah I've been there
