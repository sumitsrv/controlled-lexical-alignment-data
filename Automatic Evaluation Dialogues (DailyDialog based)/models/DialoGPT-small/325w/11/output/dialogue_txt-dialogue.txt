A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you have a_ favourite _flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: hello , [flower] [have] [you] received your card ? 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on _a theory_ . why does _the lotus spring_ to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ see [you have a] [lotus] flair _. i_ _like_ [the] _idea_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! _just_ [a] personal _theory_ [. _i] think_ _that_ [flower] preferences are _more_ revealing _of_ personality _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [more] [of] [you] liking me [that] [the lotus spring] , [than] [i] [have [a] theory] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] [like] [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon and then it came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: what's [that] _with the_ [flower ?] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 is , [you] ask someone what their favourite [flower] is . pretty much [like] what we _just_ did . does [that] make _sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [you] [just] [like] [that] [sense] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk [with the] person some [more] , and ask them some [more] questions , and gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe _two_ to five years . and voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] [two] ? 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful [idea] !
