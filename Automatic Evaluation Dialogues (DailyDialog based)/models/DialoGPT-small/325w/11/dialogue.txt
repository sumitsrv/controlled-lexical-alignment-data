Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	Hello, flower have you received your card?
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	I see you have a lotus flair. I like the idea
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I think it's more of you liking me that the lotus spring, than I have a theory
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	What's that with the flower?
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	You just like that sense
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	Step two?
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
