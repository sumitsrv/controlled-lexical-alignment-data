B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back _too much_ on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ me in terms of _time_ spent _with family and_ friends _and work life balance_ . _why do you ask ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: _how_ [have] [you] [been] [with family [and] work life balance] ? are [you] happy [with] your [life] [too much] [for] _this_ [time] ? [why do you ask ?] 
A|4| Human 1: great ! good idea to help people figuring out their _new_ [year] _resolutions_ 🙂 so [how] [do] _i_ _get_ a fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [you] [and] your [family] [have been very] helpful [and] [you] [get] [new] [resolutions] [for] [life] .

A|10| Human 1: that is actually a quote stolen from my tl when _i_ joined my first company after graduation . _i_ guess now after 5 yrs of [work] experience , _i_ fully _agree with_ it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: yes [i] [agree [with] this] [one]
