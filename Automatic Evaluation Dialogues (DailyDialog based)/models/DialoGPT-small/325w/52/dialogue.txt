Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	Oh they are giving some out!!!
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	The jacket looks the perfect cold weather sweater :D
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	I don't get that! We should make up our own weather
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	It's nice here!
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Where are you living, out of the cold and rain right?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	It was the last time they ran out. :P
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	I get the floor one and it's our favorite! Nice for your desk too.
