Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	My wife says the same thing about us raining...
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I like them too much. They are pretty good as rain tires.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	I like em too much but had trouble finding the water. We make rain tires that don't rain though.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	I think this rain can make the rroms.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	... but rain can't
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	Well this is a pretty interesting weather
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
