Human 2:	That's good news, I'm reading the first book now and I'd never heard of it anyway
Human 1:	 Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?
Human 2:	Yeah about your life.
Human 1:	 The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn
Human 2:	It's real
Human 1:	 There are other twists as well, so I haven't spoiled the whole thing! To be honest I am not a fan of spoilers
Human 2:	Are you a fan of spoilers or naw
Human 1:	 The audi book is also very good! Ever give those a try?
