Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	Hi there!
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	Oh my god you have a morning work thread for a day time? That's just going to make that much better.
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	It would work for the weekend and I have been doing that right now.
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	Oh right game the acupuncture I'm off for now
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	What's that?
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	A game that has a comic was like. Who wrote the paper? Lol
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	No it's not like that but that you say you've been to the strip. It's funny.But don't be offended.Haha
