Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	She smiles It's good to see the sun.
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Shaun I need you to stop being all day for the beach sun, it's making this awkward You're just too good to me... Haha
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	Hey Haha that's pretty funny hahah, you need work
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	He
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	hahaha very interesting.
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	Yeah yes but not the easier routes when you fall down
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	Yeah actually I have never gone outside, you?
