Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	I had it the other day. It was awkward I couldn't do anything
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	It was the last time i had it, like i said.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	It's okay... I like it. The long time of your life makes for more exciting adventures
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
