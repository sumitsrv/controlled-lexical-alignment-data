Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	I am you. What about you
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	It isn't invisible. You can see. What you won't see...
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	It would be nice for the machine learning research that they do not do this for.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	I can't see anything that would tell you the brain activity of the person's brain... and it won't be for me
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	Science, Science can tell you something and is godly.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	No Science can tell you the difference between what I believe and what would be good science?
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	Science doesn't make sense
