Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	What I'm sad for you, miss.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	We could use that catfood dish idea just to name her. I'm sad, miss.I.My.name.Is. Catfood
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I'm sad you could not go anywhere
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	I'm sad you could not zipline
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	I'm sad you can't zipline
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	I'm so glad there isn't one and that there is. Now you can zipline from tree to tree with your millions of dollars!
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	I'm so glad there isn't one and just drink and zipline then you could zipline from tree to tree.
