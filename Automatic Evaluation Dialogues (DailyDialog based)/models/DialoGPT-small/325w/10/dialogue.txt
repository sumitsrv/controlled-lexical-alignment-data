Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm going to the beach!
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Oh well it's fine, that one made me think of history.
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	He said it's fine, didn't say that he won the Civil War
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	I know right!
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I know right! What does she do!
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	That's great, but you know how it was born right?!
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	Yeah you were born right! That sounds cool! So pretty cool of you!
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	I've never won money! Wow.
