Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	I'm you know, one of the kids and a little girl would want to join.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	If you stay around the Disney resort and then go to Disneyland they have loads of fun, would it not be more fun for you?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	That is a lot fun
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yes that would work.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	If you have the money for Christmas eve then not sure about that.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	I think that time is for your old year to come back and you can take the lead on this
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	You can take his legos.M'k about this time you want to start your new life.
