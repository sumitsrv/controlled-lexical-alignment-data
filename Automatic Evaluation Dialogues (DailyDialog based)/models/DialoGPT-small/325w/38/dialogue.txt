Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	I think about you, human bot
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	The last few years have been the most peaceful so far. you guys got some great progress over there too
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	I think about the last few years. Like impersorons
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	This monologue time is funny!
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	I!
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	I like the idea!
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	I can already tell you this is going to be like one of the better ones haha good job on that research monologue!
