Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	I'm great. What about you?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	You won? I'm just about to do that but you're still very kind.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	Well your game's beautiful I guess that's the secret!
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	This game was for a racquetball competition I'm at with 3 of my friends.
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	Racing match for HCF on I guess you won with all that cage action.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	That sounds like a fun sport tbh.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
