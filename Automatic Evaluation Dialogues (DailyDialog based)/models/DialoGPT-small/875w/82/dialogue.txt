Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	I'm just enjoying the moment
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	You guys taste good. How's your health? haha This is for the Peru one actually
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	A very good one actually. haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	You would say that you taste nice for not getting reincarnated haha
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	Well it was for the Neural Link not you brain. haha
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	Yes it was. Ahh, after you get your brain to make that task much harder for sure haha.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
