Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	What's one you get lots of people to meet
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	How many people you get to meet? Hard to keep count
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	When was Australia's last one? Maybe we were getting them before then?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	That's really interesting and fascinating stuff... The people are what matters it seems.
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	How are you coming from where people were? How are people coming and what's it like living there?
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	We are really coming from where people are and what is spooky interesting
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	I've got a treasure hunting machine and you're welcome to buy it if you want!
