Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Yea theres kids and for me it would be you know Disneyland trip around Christmas time
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	That would have been the plan for you and kids stay together. It'd just be fun to drive around Disneyland Disneyland at Christmas
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	I will join you and drive!!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	We can look for that closeby
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	You think Disney will close closed then?
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	Might want to take that time you are getting the year old christmas for your birthday.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	Might take that time for your son's christmas? What are you getting?
