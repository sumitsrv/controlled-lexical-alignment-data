Human 2:	What company you have been with for the past years? Nice time to meet you! What do the team think about your career plans?
Human 1:	 That sounds like a perfect plan!
Human 2:	I like this plan. What about your team you have been with for the time so you can learn something from your time over.
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	Yes
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	I prefer the menu then, but your options are you want it over something else first and then lunch sync?
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
