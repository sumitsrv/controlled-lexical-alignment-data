A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [have] this _flower ._ _it_ has [a] beautiful design . 
A|4| Human 1: i'm _working_ on [a] _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _it_ [does] _i_ [have] [the lotus] [working] too [you] _are_ right about _it_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ _research_ ! just [a] personal _theory_ . _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences [are] _more_ revealing of personality _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [the lotus] [flower] , [i] [have] [that] [theory] too . but [you] can only [research] one thing . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower .] as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon _and_ then [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: _what_ 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone [what] their favourite [flower] is . pretty _much_ _like_ [what] we just did . [does] [that] make sense so _far_ ? 
B|11| Human 2:  ? [you] [are] [the] [flower] [what] [far] [and] [like] [that] [with] [much] [more] [than] me 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense of [what] they're [like] , over [the] course of maybe two to five _years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2:  ... you're [not] [far] [and] [flower] ... _that's_ [more] [years] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
