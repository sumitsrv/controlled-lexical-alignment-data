B|3| Human 2: _how_ [have] [you] [been] [for] [life] [and work life balance] [with family] [friends and work] [time] ?

B|11| Human 2: no [you] [agree with] [that] [one] bit ... _yay_ 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; _i_ think [family] [and] [friends] play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may _mean_ exploring around [with] [new] _stuff_ 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... so on 🙂 [what] about [you ?] [is] there a right answer to [this] ? :)
