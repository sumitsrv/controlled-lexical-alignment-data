Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	She shakes her head I've been pondering someone though scenario, but I guess I need help here.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	She chuckles I like the other person's help too. But now I need someone to take their friendship for good.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	Why now's not friends the I feel like
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A are all the friendship?? friends from everyone's AK friend might. like now?
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	A it's not balance It's from the fact : People
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	H I'm single Lol what's the balance for me but it doesn't always have to be that way
