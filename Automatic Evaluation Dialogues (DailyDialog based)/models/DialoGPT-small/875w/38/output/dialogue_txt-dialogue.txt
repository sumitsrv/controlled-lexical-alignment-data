A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: nah [you] _can_ play [bots] [like] [human] [chat bots] _now_ , its only been [about] _a_ month or _so_ . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ _some_ _great progress_ _over_ last few years . do [you] _think_ _the positives_ outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: yay , [you] [have] [great progress] , _and_ _some of_ [the positives] [made] me smile [about] _it_ ! _good_ job ! 
A|6| Human 1: _like impersorsination_ ? though [it] sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: nope you'll [have] [some] [the positives] ! [like impersorsination] . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some of] these [bots] are very engaging [and] funny . they are [now] [good] at even sarcasm _i_ wonder how far are we from [the] _time_ these _bots start_ giving _monologues_ :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [like] [that] [bots] [and] [monologues] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _think_ [it] [can] _take_ many different forms as [a] product . [the] research implication is also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai research has progressed [so] far [and] better place _to_ tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: yay 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already do _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: yeah _, [pretty_ good] [now] [and] [time] for [the] auto [bots start] [will] [take] [over] . 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ [, pretty] far fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: ya [good] [now] [and] [time] [to] [think about] [the] future [haha]
