Human 2:	Well, you and I going about the world. How about you?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	I would, and sometimes I go see places you would be going from.
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	What about the things you would dive?
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	Yeah you're totally right that's amazing
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	Merry Christmas! You should share
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
