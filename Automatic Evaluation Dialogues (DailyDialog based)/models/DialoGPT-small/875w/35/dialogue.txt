Human 2:	What are you gonna be working today? I'm an undergrad studying Biology
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	That was actually gonna happen haha I'm high school
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	No high school actually haha I'm gonna be a brain surgeon someday. I wanna take a shot at Biology at this point
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Like... high school? I don't think that's gonna happen haha
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I wanna practice something that can actually work on your brain
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	How was I born that way? I have one brain with two fingers though
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	I can't even think about this with too much thought, and you have the same brain that born for school.
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
