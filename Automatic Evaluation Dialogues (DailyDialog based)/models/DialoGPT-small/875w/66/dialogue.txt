Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I am on a marathon time and have been since around 3.1 k. I just keep getting 2.3 k
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I am planning to marathon you this time!
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Thanks for the answer and you like Spartan race
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	What's the race like and which obstacle types are you doing?
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Cool for next obstacle race, not too many obstacles but one of the many events i will be doing in Monterey's high water park.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	2 months? It's good for you
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I can practice with you
