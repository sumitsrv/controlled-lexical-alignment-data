Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	What are some ways they can help? I heard they got some from microkitchen.net
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	I guess that the jacket they are giving out isn't working..
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Oh good that's great for you. Its cold weather right?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	It was much cold where you live for the past 3 days
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Hey New Jersey! Where did you live before?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Ahhh the time for the last time... they ran out of that chocolate. Its better right?
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	I can guess what your the one in our floor that is there right now.
