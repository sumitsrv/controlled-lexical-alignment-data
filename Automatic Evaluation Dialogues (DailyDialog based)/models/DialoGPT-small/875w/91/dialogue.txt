Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	I'm sorry, been a busy morning.
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	You have been through work day for your entire life I'm sorry you feel that way!
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	This right here I'm going through work day for the most interesting week that I have been a redditor and a youtuber for far now...
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	Yes I've been acupuncture? and you always have, the work?
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 I did the literature paper
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	That comic was the best comic I've did.
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	Oh it's not the comic I'm going to say but that's funny enough. I've already been here since you were here and was not ready
