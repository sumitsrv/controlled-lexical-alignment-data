Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hi everyone I'm just here to talk about pingpong
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	How about that I won for you. What's your name again? It's great to know you made it.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	You just make that game I'm very happy you won
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Haha I'm just taking that you like rac
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	Well I'm just making that game you like racquetball with a cage match
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I'd like for it to get physical and I'm just being tennis with a cage match
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
