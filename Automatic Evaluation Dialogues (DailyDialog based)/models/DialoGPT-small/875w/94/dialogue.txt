Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	So you're the guy who wanted lunch with me. Have had that conversation a few times now. I didn't think I'd respond but the responses
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	We did eat and it was very good, so you had that conversation with me, I never talked to you back yet you still don't reply back
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm vegetarian. I eat fish and shrimp for lunch though
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	Lulz what though was going for dinner
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	So you had the different kinds and all I love them
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	What's the peanut butter though??
