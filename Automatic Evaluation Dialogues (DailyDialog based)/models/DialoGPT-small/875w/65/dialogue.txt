Human 2:	Hi and welcome! How's your day going so far?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I work out and this's the way I figure that I can't afford diesel lol
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Yea lol that
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
