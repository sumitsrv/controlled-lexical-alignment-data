Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	Hello day I'm great thanks what the day is right?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	Hi day thanks and I'm hash browns which always feel delicious.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I eat one food and you would only be hungry the day before. I'm a vegetarian though.
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	Not you think.
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I could eat one
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	Yeah I would like one more food and it's been a day.
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
