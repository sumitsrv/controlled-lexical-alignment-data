A|4| Human 1: glad to hear _you're_ better . sorry to hear _you_ were _sick_ . i _was_ _sick_ a couple of _weeks_ ago _with_ a _bad_ _cough_ . there's definitely a bug [going] _around_ . admit i _just_ want to _stay_ healthy _for the holidays_ _and_ _plan_ to relax . 
B|5| Human 2: _yes_ [and] [you] [stay] [with] [your] friend's [the holidays] [around] [the] [day] . there [was] [just] this [sick] [cough] [for] [weeks] .

B|7| Human 2: so [you] [plan] [for] [holidays] ? 
A|8| Human 1: me _too_ . now i have folks come visit me _for the holidays !_ but that's _also_ tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [too] [bad] [for the holidays !] 
A|10| Human 1: [yes] ! we set up an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas_ _tree_ [and] put up some _colorful_ led _lights_ which is very festive .
