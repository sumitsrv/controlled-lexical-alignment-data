Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	Well you have met me in the past. It's cool. I don't think I ever stopped meeting people.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	I don't recall you meeting me at the dance
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	That's you :P
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm the private practice I have you
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	Are you not that private practice? I'm sure we know what the answer to your question is.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	it's not that private practice but I'm sure you know what the real job is
