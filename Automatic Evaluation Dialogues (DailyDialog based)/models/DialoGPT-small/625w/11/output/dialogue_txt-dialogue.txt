A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ _favourite_ _flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: _is_ _it_ _ok_ _to_ [have a] [flower] [you] can call your [favourite] ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on [a] _theory_ . why does _the_ _lotus_ _spring_ [to] _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [a] [lotus] [flower] [i'm] [the] [spring] _of_ [the] sun 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just a_ personal _theory_ . i think _that flower_ preferences are _more_ revealing [of] _personality_ _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] [that] interesting in [it's] [mind] [i'm] [more] interested in [the] [flower] [theory] [than] [personality] . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon and then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: how's [that [flower] ?] 
A|10| Human 1: [ok] , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what their [favourite] [flower] [is] . pretty much _like_ what we _just_ did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [just a] [flower] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk _with_ [the] person some [more] , and ask _them_ some [more] questions , and gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're _like_ , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . and voila 
B|13| Human 2: nay [with] [them] they [like] [you] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
