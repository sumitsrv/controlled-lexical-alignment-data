Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I would like some coffee. Howdy from your lovely new day's date.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	Hi and welcome. How's your day going so far?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	A car that's diesel and the mechanic wasn't supposed to work lol
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I m't work today.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Yeah the game you should think so and they work fine. That's good.
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Well the last game you should think so. they work fine.
