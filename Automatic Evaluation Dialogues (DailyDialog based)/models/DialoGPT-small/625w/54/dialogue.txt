Human 1:	 Hi!

Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	how you doong? good just doing good
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	How about that pingpong game you won recently? I'm still kind of taking credit but just for a very long time?
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I just won I guess you are taking credit for your game
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Yes I'm racquetball thank you very
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	The cage match I'm hosting at r racquetball with that guy is a good game
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I like it being really athletic and tiring for that very reason.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
