Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	How are they giving out goodies?
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	Can the jacket be cold? or did they give out goodies?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Yay! Its cold weather for the rest of the month :D
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	I live in the UK for some reason. Its nice out today!
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	I live in the Uk but I don't even get cold weather for that!
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Yup, last time they ran out for the same place, but now you can get it right now!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	Yup, the one by our floor
