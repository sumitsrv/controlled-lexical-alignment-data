Human 2:	It does mean what it sounds like
Human 1:	 Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?
Human 2:	Not what i just said that the event does replaying, i mean the game wont load the map when the timer ends
Human 1:	 How do you know so much about this French phrase?
Human 2:	I know this French phrase that you just said, much like how the song about How is this event replaying
Human 1:	 yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.
Human 2:	a little before that i thought about the event you just replaying etcetera...
Human 1:	 wdym by word origins here?
Human 2:	dym the origins way
Human 1:	 Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂
Human 2:	A lot of us think this event is replaying the origins of the song that you just wrote today. Very interesting!
