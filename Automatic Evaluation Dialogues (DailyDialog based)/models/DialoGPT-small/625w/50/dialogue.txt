Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	I don't know your day's going terribly busy either.
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	It's actually very busy for the weekend that day.
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	Not Europe and the Euro's are actually fun for me.
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	I'm heading for the Europe this weekend but having fun. It's so great and you just have european culture.
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	Is spanish really too much?
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
