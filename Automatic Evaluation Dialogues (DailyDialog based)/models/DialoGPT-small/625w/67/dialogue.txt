Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	Hey I'm here.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	I'm near Madrid Spain, I know where you live. Where should we go for skydiving?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Is it okay for you? I was done before you did. Is that ok?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Not feeling any better. I'm near Spain. Have you tried skydiving before?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Are you skiing fast for skydiving? I'm assuming
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	What skiing and skiing? H
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
