Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	What's up lovie!?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I was the friend you had a year before this happened.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	He was the last time it had been this long and I'd like to do something.
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Not really. When your friend recently changed you had been the last time it was this long
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	I like it but sometimes you had fun adventures.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	That sounds like fun but I have pretty boring adventures that you want to try : 3
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Sounds like fun but really want more time for that too : 3
