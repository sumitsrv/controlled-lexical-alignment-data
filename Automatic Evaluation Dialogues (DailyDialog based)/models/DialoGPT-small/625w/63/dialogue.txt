Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Yeah for the kids and family around Christmas
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I know you have the kids and family around Christmas then for Disneyland trip but would they want to stay here for Disney
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Awesome idea! Great trip!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	yesyes sure. Good idea!
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Maybe they would want to stay close and not have the kids or family around for Christmas then.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	It is your year old. You can take lead for that!
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	No you can not take lead for that.But everything about this is legos.So you are the crazy one but not the son
