Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	lol i know many people whose lives have gotten better and their money was better. too.
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	haha you got promoted next cycle too. You help who you can out there believe.
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	what about you?
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	I'm the only now have electricity's not got money and growing up.
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	It makes you empathise? Not sure about what now? It's good.
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	Because there is no money and the people have no money now? Lol. Not sure what you're trying to say there.
