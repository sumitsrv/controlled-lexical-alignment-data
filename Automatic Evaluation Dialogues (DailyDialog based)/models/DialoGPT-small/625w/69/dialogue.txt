Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	Ya got our turkey last night! Also Thanksgiving dinner with the party.
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	It was fun.
