A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ reflect _back_ _too_ _much_ on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ me _in_ terms of _time spent with family_ _and_ _friends and work life balance_ . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _when_ _did you_ [have] [back] surgery [and] [don't] remember [much] [time spent with family] [friends and work life balance] ? 
A|4| Human 1: great ! _good_ _idea_ to _help_ _people_ figuring out their _new year resolutions_ 🙂 so how do _i_ _get_ _a_ fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [have been very] [good] [with] [people] [and] [new year resolutions] _for the_ past 2 years . [you] [get] [back] [in] [time] ! 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if _we_ practice that ! [i] think _the idea_ does [have] some potential . how [did you] come up _with this_ _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [we] [did] [this] [you] [have] [new] [the idea] [too] . 
A|8| Human 1: thats great ! [this] is valuable _help_ [for the] community . [i] think _mental_ health is _one_ of [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [this] [one] ... [help] [with] [mental] [and] [the] [family] . 
A|10| Human 1: that is actually _a_ quote stolen _from_ my tl [when] [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i] guess _now_ after 5 yrs of [work] experience , [i] fully _agree with_ it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [agree [with] this] [for] sure 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] think [family] [and] [friends] play _a_ big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies that keep [you] busy ... so on 🙂 [what] about [you] ? is _there_ _a_ right answer to [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: lt 3 . s [now] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! that's [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 _also_ music _earned a spot_ 🙂 _yay_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [may] [you] [yay] [from] [there] [and] [earned a spot] . [also] happy [now] ? 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually not [much] of [a] reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ _reading_ books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: love [reading] 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! it [may] turn out to be [a] best seller :)
