Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	Hi! It's good to hear everyone is having a good time here!
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Oh look you're in the beach season day thread. You're welcome all around! What's good? Haha
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	Haha that's nice. What you think the beach will look like? H
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	ah hahaha that's funny, sounds good!
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	haha
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	It's all psychological
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	It sounds like your psychological issue is not the climbing.
