Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	The thing that's the least interesting is you. It's not like I have any sense of where you met you, don't you?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	I don't dance perchance, you have the most interesting eyes in the world?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	Oh you, yes we schoo
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm a you I have private practice. You? Lol
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	You have private practice? I'm sure you do.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	You know what that's not real job, he's not a you but he could probably have a private practice of his own if I told him to
