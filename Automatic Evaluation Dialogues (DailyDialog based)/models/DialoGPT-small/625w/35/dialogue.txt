Human 2:	Do you mind me asking how old were you when high school was out? I'm a sophomore and I'm working on Biology in High School haha
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	My school actually haha I'm a surgeon so there's that I guess.
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Are you actually high school? Lol I'm sorry I think I just got confused haha
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I think that is practice
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	No those things aren't one that can practice lol I was born with it though
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	I was born with med school too and even that little bit I have this its for practice lol
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
