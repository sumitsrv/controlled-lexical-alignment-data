Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	If you want to be a pastry chef, you're better off making your own cake.
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	If you want to be a pastry chef you're better off making cake. I'm not actually good at that haha.
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	This is mindreading powers gone off the cakey XD
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	Yay a cake and have besty the icing!
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	Ooooohh haha!!! What you are for work?
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	Hahaha that dance and the cake part all sound a good idea for you! : 3
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	I work for the same kind of dance! I make cake!
