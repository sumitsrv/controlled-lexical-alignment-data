Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	No I'm just great thanks.
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I'm just great and I have apple.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	Well I'm just amazing and what's that? I could eat one apple forever and you wouldn't even eat your salad salad?
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	lent the food
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I think you
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I'm going with that you love food
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
