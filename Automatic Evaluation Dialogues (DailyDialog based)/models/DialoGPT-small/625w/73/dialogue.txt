Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I just got back from going to watch the day
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	What's good How are you?
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	Merry Christmas. I'm going to watch the Warriors play some basketball
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	Yeah I see them all the time
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	It's all cool I'm the original guy with name NeurIPS
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	Hey I'm the original guy with that name! Sounds cool
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	Haha I'm the original guy with that name!!
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Ahh that was very scary... What about the movie Wall? I think I called it that once too.
