Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	I'd say your name has been far more appropriate thus far. How is your morning, though?
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	You're going through work right now that I'm aware of, you have time for your day
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	I would have you work for me and the day would be much much longer right now
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	Yes. the game is acupuncture.
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	I've reviewed?
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	Who wrote the comic? Where did it originate?
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	I don't know but I assure you it's appropriate here and not inappropriate for a comic like this.
