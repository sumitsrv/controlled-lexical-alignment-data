Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	This is not the place to discuss any particular scenario, you've been warned.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	Well the other person are not the right friend to date you in their friendship, I'm afraid. Just take out of the relationship for now.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I am friends
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A lot I'm from all friends already not friends
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	Why not have the balance always?
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	Why not make it like the one I'm used to from single?
