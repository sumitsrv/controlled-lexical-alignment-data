Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	I do not know you, I'm not even sure how I'm doing. I know you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	I do not know you, but this has been fun time, friend.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	It was actually a really fun time.
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Hahhaha no it was a fun time.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	You had fun for the time you had but it was really not that much. You didn't have any adventures at all
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	It was really hard.I have been riding for years and I have no interest in roller coasters
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	Hey look at your date.That sounds like fun time!
