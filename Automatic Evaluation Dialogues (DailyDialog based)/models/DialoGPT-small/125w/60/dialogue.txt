Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	I got a good chuckle out of my day today! Thank you!
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	It was the best day of my life when I went rock climbing. How about you?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	I was there with a bunch of great people! What movie were you part of?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	That's an amazing movie!
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	The movie's good but it can be scary when it's dark out
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	I was in Australia?
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	I was from Australia but am still
