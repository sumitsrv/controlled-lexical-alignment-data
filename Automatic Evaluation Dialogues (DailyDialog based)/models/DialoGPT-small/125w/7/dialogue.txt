Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	This is good but Avatar should've been nominated not Best Picture.
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	I feel it's the one movie that has an element of science with non human creatures
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	I have watched non movie!
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	I watch movies.
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	What do you like in your life and what will you eat for dinner?
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	Oh and I will eat you noodle soup out of your hand
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	You seem like you're a cook.
