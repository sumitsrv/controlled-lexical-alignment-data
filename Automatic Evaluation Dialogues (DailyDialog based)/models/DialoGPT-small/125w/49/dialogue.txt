Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	It's your day to shine.
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	You have a day of work until you are done with exams and exams, that's enough for me to start studying for the weekend.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	You are now the proud owner of your next live match against Leicester. Are you happy now?
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	You can watch the match live? Hokey is actually really fun though.
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	You will be training
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	D
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	Well that's nice. Yeah, if you have to put the time out, I can't be bothered to give you props
