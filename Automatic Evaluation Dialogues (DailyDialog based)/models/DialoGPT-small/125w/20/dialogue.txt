Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	My favorite food would be Chinese Food. I think I am one of those people.
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	It's pretty popular in India too. You know the Chinese ones. I'm not sure you can say ice cream.
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Ice cream.
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	Oh, you like ice
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	Do you feel
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	I love the physical world we experience, most of my experiences have been like those
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
