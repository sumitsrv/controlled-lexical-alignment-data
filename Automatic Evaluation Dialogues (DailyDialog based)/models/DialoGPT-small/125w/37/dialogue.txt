Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	Hello you! How's it going? I'm happy for some great times! What about you? How you doin '
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	Well you can play with friends but you can also not, I think. What are your goals and hobbies?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	Good idea?
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	What's the game?
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	That's amazing, and I like to read for fun too! It's great to have!
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	The most recent thing I read was the story of a horse in a basket called O'Brien
