Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	Do you know many people whose lives are too long to live?
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	I don't believe that many people who can read have seen miracles. You are too busy to be a minder.
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	What?
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	We need electricity, not much..
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	You?
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	I don't get how you can have a lot of money without any people seeing it.
