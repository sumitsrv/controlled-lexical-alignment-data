A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back _too_ _much_ on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ me _in_ terms of time spent _with family and friends_ _and_ work _life_ balance . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _how_ [have] [you] [been] [with family and friends] [in] general ? _how_ has [life] [been] [for] [you] as _a_ person who hasn't had _a_ [life] change ? 
A|4| Human 1: great ! good _idea_ to help people figuring out their _new year_ resolutions 🙂 so [how] do _i_ get [a] fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [too] _am_ [new year] [and] [have been very] _busy_ [with family] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice that ! _i think_ _the idea_ does [have] some potential . [how] did [you] come up [with] [this] _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [this] [the idea] 
A|8| Human 1: thats great ! [this] _is_ valuable help [for] [the] community . [i think] mental health _is_ one of [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: thank [you] [very] [much] 
A|10| Human 1: that _is_ actually [a] _quote_ stolen _from_ my tl when [i] joined my _first_ company after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs of work experience , [i] fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [this] [quote] [is] [from] [the] [first] post . 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family and friends] play [a] big role here . 2 . meaningful work life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies that keep [you] [busy] ... so on 🙂 [what] about [you] ? [is] there [a] right answer to [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [this] [quote] ???? 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! that's [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 _also_ music earned [a] spot 🙂 _yay_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: you're welcome ! [also] happy [yay] 
A|16| Human 1: [i] [am] actually not [much] of [a] reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ _reading_ books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [how] [much] [reading] 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! it may turn out to be [a] best seller :)
