A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: have _you_ _seen_ any _good_ _movies_ lately ? 
A|2| Human 1: last _weekend_ _i_ saw "the _parasite_ . " ever heard _of_ _it_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: i'm confused ? _the_ [parasite] _movies_ always _do_ _that_ . they have their own special meaning in _my_ mind . 
A|4| Human 1: [my] friend wanted to _see_ _it_ . _it has_ great reviews on imdb _and_ rotten tomatoes ! what did [you] [do] last _weekend_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: this _is_ [my] favorite movie [and] [i] [see] them all at least once _a_ month . 
A|6| Human 1: oooo _the mandalorian_ ?!?! 
B|7| Human 2: it's called [the mandalorian] [and] there _was a_ huge amount [of] star wars fanfare . 
A|8| Human 1: lol are [you] [a] big _marvel_ fan ? 
B|9| Human 2: well this [has] made [my] year . [marvel] vs dc [the] [weekend] after 
A|10| Human 1: i've _only_ [seen] _spiderman_ . honestly _it_ [was a] little _too_ scary [and] so [i] don't _think_ [i] can bring myself to _watch the_ _other_ [marvel] _movies !_ haha 
B|11| Human 2: just [watch the] [movies !] i'm [too] busy with [spiderman] [and] [marvel] 2 ! 
A|12| Human 1: oh _really_ ? to be honest _i think_ [the] actor [is] not [that] [good] looking , so not so surprising ! haha 
B|13| Human 2: yeah [i] thought [that] [was] [the] [only] movie [and] that's [really] disappointing 
A|14| Human 1: who [is] _loki_ ? i've never heard [that] name before 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] it's [loki] [the] hulk [and] [it has] some [other] characters [that] [i]
