Human 2:	You just want to be invited back to ski school.

Human 2:	Lol it's ok. If you got that close to ice wall just slam it back and forth into a corner.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	That's cool man haha but I think you forgot that I'm french
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	I know. I was just curious cause the montreal and brampton roads are very similar.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	Yep the Olympics
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
