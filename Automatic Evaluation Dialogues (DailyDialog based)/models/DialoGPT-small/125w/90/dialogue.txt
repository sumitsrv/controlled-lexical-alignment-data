Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	I would like to volunteer.
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	If the organizers do send out the invitations to events for a few weeks before and after the event goes live, what will the final prize be?
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	I will be attending the event for my book and tour
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	You're with this event
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	Hi, I have the sunday.You.Need.Done.M?
