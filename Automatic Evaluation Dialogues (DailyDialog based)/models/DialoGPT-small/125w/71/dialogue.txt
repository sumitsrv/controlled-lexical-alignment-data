Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	Awww! I'll come over later and pick up a few things.
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	Ohhh! I'm still here, I'm so excited!
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	Haha! I'm sad, but angry and lonely.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	You seem angry. I'm sad that you lost one loved.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	No worries, got some free hugs and now I am sad. Thank you for asking!!
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	I'm just trying out keto. It's pretty awesome and I'm very happy with how I feel going
