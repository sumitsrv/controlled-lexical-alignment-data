Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	You look great! I'm proud to meet you as well, my friend!
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I'm happy to eat eggs and hash browns, I'm afraid.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	I eat eggs and hash browns, but only if I could have breakfast
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	you say, muddle.
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I like how the other two
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I feel like you're being a bit pedantic. What I'm feeling is food... not food. But food
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
