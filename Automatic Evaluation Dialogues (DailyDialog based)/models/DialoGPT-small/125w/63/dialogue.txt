Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Hey. Hey. Thanks for posting. Hope you enjoy the ride! Happy holidays!!!
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	How are you coming to Disney resort for the Disney World trip? Are you planning on staying in California and visiting the Disneyland Resort? I would love it
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Haha sounds good.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	I have the address.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	Do you have a hotel for Christmas eve?
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	Could you do your math for the year old one? If not I can take that off your list.But then it will be on christmas eve
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	How old are you? Do you need the year old one for your son as well?
