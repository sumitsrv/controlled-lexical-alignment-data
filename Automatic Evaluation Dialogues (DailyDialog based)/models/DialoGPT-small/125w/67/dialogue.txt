Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	It's okay. I'm glad you're getting back to your normal self.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Where are you from?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	Have you done the whole trepidatious thing?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	Nice. Have fun bro. Hope you can do it before summer is done.
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Thanks for the reply. I don't ski very much but you never know how that thing will go :D
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Awesome! How long
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
