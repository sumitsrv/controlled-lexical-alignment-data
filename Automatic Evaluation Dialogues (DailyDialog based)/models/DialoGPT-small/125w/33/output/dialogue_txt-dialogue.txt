A|4| Human 1: i've _done_ _them_ once or twice so far , _but_ they haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm] trying to figure out why . what kind of cookies _have_ you _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ _a_ baker . my croissant's [have] [been] [done] [flakey] [but] _i_ [made] [them] in my oven . [it's] [been] _a_ couple 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: ohhh [i'm] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] good idea . i'll give it [a] try next time . would you say you [have] [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: ohhhh 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , _me_ too , [i] _think i'd_ _eat pastries_ all _the_ time if [i] _could get away with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think i'd] ever [eat pastries] [that] [could get away with] [the] creme sauce on [me] . 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention to [that] sort of stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: m 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need to enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
