Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Happy Monday everyone!
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	How you doing? I'm good, you?
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	Hate you Warriors but I'm still alive. Thanks for the game.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	The Golden State Chairs! Haha...
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	You should see the Neur IPS in the background. Neuron?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	No I believe that's The New York Chairs.
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	I'm not an expert on the subject but I'm about that.
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	And the movie was called Wall e. So I heard this from a friend IRL.
