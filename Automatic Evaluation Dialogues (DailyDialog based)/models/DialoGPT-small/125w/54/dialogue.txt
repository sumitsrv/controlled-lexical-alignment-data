Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hi, great! How are you?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	Good job! It's very common for you to win that way I'm still wondering about the other guy
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	Nice, I'm still playing that kind of game called pingpong. That's my favourite game. I'm very happy for you
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm in! I'll be in a cage match with you guys
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	We think it's fun, but a sport for other people!
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
