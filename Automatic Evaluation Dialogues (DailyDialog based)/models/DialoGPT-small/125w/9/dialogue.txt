Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?
Human 1:	 Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?
Human 2:	Why do I do this to my fellow kids, it is your day. Very well, How has your day been?
Human 1:	 Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.
Human 2:	I'm ok. Thanks for your concern.
Human 1:	 Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!
Human 2:	I'm glad for relaxation.
Human 1:	 Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..
Human 2:	I know what you meant. : I'm ok for holidays?
Human 1:	 Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.
Human 2:	Will you be going? I'm looking for the Christmas lights, and I've been looking to put some
Human 1:	 Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.
Human 2:	You?
Human 1:	 Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.
Human 2:	.
Human 1:	 Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.
Human 2:	Christmas trees.
Human 1:	 Great, I hope you find a nice tree.
