Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	I like you! What does your plan to spend your money look like?
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	I have pumpkin pie and pizza with pumkins on it! Thanks for asking.
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	Thanks.I think pumpkin pie would be sweet, more family with you soon
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	I would say you need more family then pumpkin pie for christmas.
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	Christmas everything! :D
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	I bought you for the most price and then you got scared?
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
