Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	It's a day late and I'm late tonight. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I work in the morning and I m going to get the new tires and new fork fixed, so this is your normal day.
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	The mechanic has this in the shop and now it broke down on the way home so that's why it wasn't fixed...
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Nope?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	How's that going btwv btw?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I'm not the one trying to refute their record you should know that
