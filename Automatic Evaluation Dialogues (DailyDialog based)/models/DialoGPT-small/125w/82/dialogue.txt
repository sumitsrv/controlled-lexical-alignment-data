Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Yo, what's up fam?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	What are you up to now fam?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	That's good for your health. How about you? Just enjoying yourself with a cigar, fam?
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	The only way to live is to just enjoy yourself haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	I live for the reincarnation, not the actual
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	I live for the death of the brain
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	Yeah I see that you don't live for life
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
