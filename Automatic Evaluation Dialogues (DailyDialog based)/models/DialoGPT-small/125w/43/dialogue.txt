Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	I would be the one doing this for you if I were participating!
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	I love this!!! I don't know how to feel about this! What are you going to be participating in the mentorship program for?
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	Yeah I signed up a few months ago, have been on the waiting list this time.
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	It's pretty good but it's 1:1
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	I'm just about the same. A mentor you say :
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	Thank you. I have been training with this for a few months.It is very cool.
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
