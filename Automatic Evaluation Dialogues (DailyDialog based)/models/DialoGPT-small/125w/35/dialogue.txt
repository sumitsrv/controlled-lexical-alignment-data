Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Yeah, that's why they put it there
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I think you can practice highschool in that spot.
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	It was something that you have to try and think about first and maybe even one day you can practice
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	So you mean the school you're going into for your med school and all that.
