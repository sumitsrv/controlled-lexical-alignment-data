Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	It's for the machine learning. What you do and what you do is the answer to that question.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	What's this machine learning thing that you can do?
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	You can't tell the brain from the bone that's why. We believe in the soul. Science.
