Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	I just got a call from a doctor, about a heart attack. I need to get well ASAP because I'm so tired. How are you?
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	No sir, but you have interesting plans for today...
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	Hey guys, this is really nice, you guys are cool for coming out to the place. And have an awesome birthday.
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	So youhavent got it
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	So you don't? I got the conference??
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	Hey friend and they come to the conference
