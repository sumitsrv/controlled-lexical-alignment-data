Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	She nods and shrugs It's okay, I don't recall you at the moment.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	She's still not the greatest dance partner
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	I'm still with you, you have nothing against me.
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	She looks at you I'm pretty sure you have the best cardiologist. You and you're gonna be great to practice with together. Do tell,
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	She's not sure what I'm talking about. Maybe you know a little.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I'm sure he's not elitist, I just know what a real job feels like.
