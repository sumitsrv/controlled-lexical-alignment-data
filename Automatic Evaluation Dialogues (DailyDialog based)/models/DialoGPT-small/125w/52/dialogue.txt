Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	And they are giving out some goodies today???
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	What does the jacket even look like?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	I hate the cold... good for you though. And the jacket.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	The weather was nice... I guess that is what you get in a warm weather place.
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Hey there! New York and I live right next the border of the US! Where you been?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Yeah! Well you should get the goodies... I guess.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
