Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	Well, okay, I guess your new friend is flying by.

Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	Good what, I'm going to the world
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	I don't you just walk. I dive with a cylinder in your body
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	I'm going to explore much places and you
