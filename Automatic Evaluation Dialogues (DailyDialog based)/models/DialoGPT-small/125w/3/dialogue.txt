Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	What an odd thread title. Is anyone watching it? It's raining pretty bad today.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	I like the rain in the background too. Makes them look like days.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	I don't like it as much now because the water was always raining too
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	Yawny. The weather is back!
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Rain water, but its still raining
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	Oh that was the water drought, there are still rain water shortages
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
