Human 2:	That sounds good actually. I'm gonna school tomorrow and I wanna be a surgeon hahaha
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Sounds good actually. I'm gonna school tomorrow.
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	It can take you that long to practice something and I'm going to school tomorrow
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	Oh you have one though.I think you can't practice that with those things. Kind of something I thought wasnt as funny haha
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	So this one you can practice med for and the other? Or something too
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
