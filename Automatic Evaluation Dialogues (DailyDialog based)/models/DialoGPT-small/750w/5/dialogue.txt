Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	He did have catnip... and I'm sad to say he was a bit lonely...
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	She just tried her catfood dish and I'm sad to say she couldn't do anything. Anyway your day going great
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I've tried to go anywhere, and I'm sad you weren't going where
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	Yes you can zipline
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	If you could zipline from tree to tree I'm scared right now.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	If there isn't one then you should make millions right now and zipline the tree
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	If there isn't one then you should zipline the tree and drink the millions right now
