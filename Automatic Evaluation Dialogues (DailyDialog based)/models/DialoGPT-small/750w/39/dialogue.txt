Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 Any big plans for the upcoming holidays?
Human 2:	I like the idea for holidays! I've never been so excited to be so low hanging in such a short amount of time.
Human 1:	 That sounds amazing. I want to learn how to ski but I feel like I'm too old and falls would have lifelong impacts. Are you going with friends?
