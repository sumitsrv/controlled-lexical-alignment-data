Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	I would think you mean Chinese Food. What is one thing about China that interests you?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	Haha. That's a tough one. Hmm... ice cream? Chinese food. What about you?
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	Not chocolate and Chocolate too?
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	What about vanilla ice
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	What's the physical
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	I have been there and had the most physical experience ever
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
