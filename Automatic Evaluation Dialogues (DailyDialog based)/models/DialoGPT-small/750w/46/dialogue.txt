Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	No I need help with scenario I've been pondering about
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	Can I have the friendship with help not take a hang out with other people like you?
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	No they already are out fear
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A. That's not all texts from everyone I have friends
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	A balance for all the users It's used often
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	A balance for all the users It's used often. I'm finna be single means it's not good for everyone but that what they say
