Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	Morning sweet sweet love.
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	I'm going through a lot right now I have been working for the last day so it was probably that time!!
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	I'm off work now and I have this time for the day right now that you said.
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	That the game? Where does that even work?
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	I was that the literature did it?
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	I don't buy the comic.
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	I assure you it's not appropriate for the comic and I'm not even that old.
