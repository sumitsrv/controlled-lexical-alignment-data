Human 2:	What's your taste like from Peru?
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	Haha it's good for your health but haha they only live once.

Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	Well not that but would you like brain surgery after death just for getting reincarnated once?
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	I was just thinking about it haha I will see what would you think after that
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
