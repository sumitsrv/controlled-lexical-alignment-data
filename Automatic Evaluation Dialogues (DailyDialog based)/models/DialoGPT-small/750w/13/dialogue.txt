Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	Lol you did the last Mandalorian?
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	That was the scary Spiderman movies I think you can watch those too lol
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	Yeah I don't think the Spiderman movies are that good looking either haha
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	I think that Loki was the only good looking Spiderman you've heard haha
