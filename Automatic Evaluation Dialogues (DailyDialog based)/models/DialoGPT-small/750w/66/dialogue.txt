Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	Not any time in the past 2 weeks except for marathon time.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I have the marathon time now on hand, planning for any events coming up in months you see
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Do you any race time planning? It's not like marathon but a lot of it. Are you doing marathons and triathlons?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	That's it? It has obstacles
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I live in Monterey
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	What time you training for next month? 2 months? 1?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I can practice with you for the next few months. 1 2 months or a good amount of time. It's a lot of training.
