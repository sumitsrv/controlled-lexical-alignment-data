Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	You know the kids want to join you for Disneyland trip around Christmas and would you like to get back to work for a little while
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	What plan are you working out for Disney and Disneyland events the two nights away?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	So that will work
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	That would work for both nights of the Disney and Disneyland events, but not sure about that for then, they closed around christmas day. Good idea
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	yes you can take that lead and think about your idea for the year old
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	You can look for the legos.You are getting everything you can possibly think about for this year.
