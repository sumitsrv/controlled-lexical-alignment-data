Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	Hello and welcome to the subreddit. Hope you have a good rest of your days
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	Oh come by here, the holidays are just starting for you with Christmas. It will have a special place.
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	Yeah you don't have any special plans for Christmas. Where did you see?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	Why have you only been to Uganda for Christmas
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	Did you and was not you have been around for holidays?
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	It was the Uganda school project? Where did you see?
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	What was it called
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
