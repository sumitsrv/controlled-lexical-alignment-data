Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Nice, how is everyone's week going? It's great to see croissants
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	yiss thanks you have made croissants I'm trying they've been flakey enough but once I make them they taste great how's everyone
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	yiss they have fl
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	Flavour
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	I'd eat pastries with the idea that I could get away with flicking with people too, you should try!
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	Mmmmhmmmmm. that's good stuff.
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
