Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	Hey good morning! How're you today?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	I can hear darkness the day. was there a great night's day or good time's weekend?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	I did the movie about a good day in Romania in high school. It was great!
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	That movie and the same day was great Hahahahah that's amazing.
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	Did you look out the same direction when it's dark and scary?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	That's winter? Yes that nice
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	Hahh yes I can you see the great Australia too actually visit it's You like it's but definitely should try not
