Human 2:	You are too good for this world. Everything you do and say is just a tribute. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	I have plans for you when you are dead.
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	I have plans though for you! What's your year time this year? It's really beautiful here.
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	I'm really? Cool food it
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	I don't recall.
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	I attend the Japanese conference
