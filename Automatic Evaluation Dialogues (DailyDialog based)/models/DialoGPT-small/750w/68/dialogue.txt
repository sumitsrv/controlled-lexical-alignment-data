Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	How the... you know nothin ', last week was a good week for lectures.
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	It was not the best lectures you have. It was better to discuss this time.
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	Hey its going time for the test.
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	Great! Thanks
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	Sounds like fun to test the course.Good for you will.
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	I will hope for you next week. This course is not the best time to test.
