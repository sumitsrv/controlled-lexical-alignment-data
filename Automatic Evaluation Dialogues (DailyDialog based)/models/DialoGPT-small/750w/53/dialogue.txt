Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	Yay! Congra! You here yet?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	Yeah, you that the one for me? You have fun plans, too?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	Not you like that, the fun for yourself
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	I started before I have finished for the long run just so you know.
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	Not I? Haha haha
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	I like long distances and have been for a few days, not I though... Haha
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	Do marathons have long distances for you?
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	How long ago was this one? I have run marathons for the past few days.
