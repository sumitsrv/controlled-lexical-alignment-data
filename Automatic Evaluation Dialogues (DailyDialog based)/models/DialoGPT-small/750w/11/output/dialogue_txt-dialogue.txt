A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ [a] _theory_ . why does _the_ lotus spring _to_ _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm working on] [the] [theory] [you have] _i_ [have a] lot _of_ [flower] in [mind] [to] start _and_ _i_ really don't know . 
A|6| Human 1: oh , it's _not research_ ! just [a] personal [theory] . [i] think _that_ [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ revealing [of] _personality than people appreciate ._

A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk with [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're like , over [the] course [of] maybe _two_ [to] _five years_ . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] [two] [five years] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
