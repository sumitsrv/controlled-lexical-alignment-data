Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	How's it been so far?
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	Awww look at you coming indoors all the time!
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	ahaha I was the beach's day spa. It was pretty funny
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	hahaah you work near the water that sounds like an already funny thought to me hahahah
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	ahaha interesting work hahaha
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	hahaahhhhhhh Hmmm interesting
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	I'm down for some interesting and yes I have tried but never gone outside
