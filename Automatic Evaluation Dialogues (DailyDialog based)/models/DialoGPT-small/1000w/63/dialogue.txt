Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	Yea the kids were in the house for Christmas and wanted to join.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	I have heard Disneyland and Disney both want the kids for Christmas they wanted to stay here.
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	We will drive for the weekend.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	We can look for work.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	You can probably get that but not sure about the work around the Christmas eve for Disney closed events
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	I can take you for that but I would not think your work getting closed will be this year
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	I can take you for your year old work this time but I would not think that about legos.net the christmas eve
