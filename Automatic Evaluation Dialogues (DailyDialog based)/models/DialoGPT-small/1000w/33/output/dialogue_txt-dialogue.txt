B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , thanks . _i'm trying to learn how _to_ make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: what's everyone [trying [to] make] today ? [it's great] [i'm trying to learn how to] _eat_ [croissants] _and_ [i'm] having _a_ ton _of_ trouble 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far , _but_ _they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . [i'm trying to] figure _out_ why . what _kind of_ cookies _have_ you made ? 
B|5| Human 2: yay [they] flake [out] [but] [i'm trying [to] make] [them] smooth 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: yep , [they] [have] [been] [great] [but] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] good idea . i'll give it [a] try next _time_ . would you say you [have] [a] _sweet_ tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: oh [sweet] 
A|10| Human 1: some people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me too , _i_ _think i'd eat_ pastries _all the time_ if _i_ could get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think i'd eat] [a] pasty [all the time] [with] [that] [kind of] cooking 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: m 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
