Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	I work nights, so I have to sleep. How about u guys?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	That I think the game should be out too for all you guys cause chill
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	How did you even start this week for the most part I'm out sick?
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	Hey I have
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	How you like Hawaii's lotion I have it too.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	I got the same for Hawaii's lotion. It is like it never rains there. I love California beaches.
