Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I actually went roller coaster racing and the first was that world's tallest amusement park.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	It was scary but I'm not that adrenaline junkie level yet.
