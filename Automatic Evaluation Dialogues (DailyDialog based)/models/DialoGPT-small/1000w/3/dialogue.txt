Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I'm pretty wet today... it's raining really bad and it's been pretty cold out
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	They make days gloomy too
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	There were the water trouble that year too. They had a really bad rain
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	I can't survive the days without rain. Just make them wet
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	I can't survive the rain here. Just make water.
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	Oh, the drought...
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
