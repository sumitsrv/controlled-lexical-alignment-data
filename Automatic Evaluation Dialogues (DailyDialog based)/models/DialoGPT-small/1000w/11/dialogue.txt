Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	Best flower you ever have, I don't even know where to start
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	It does I'm pretty sure the lotus flower spring to mind
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	What does that have to do with it? I'm not the mind of research. Just people's personality you think are more interesting than others
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	ay it like you with the more and people's not that? The flower came to life
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	You did It's what you think that it does make sense, just like. flower?
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	... like?
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
