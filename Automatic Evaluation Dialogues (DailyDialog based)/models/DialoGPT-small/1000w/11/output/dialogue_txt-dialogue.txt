A|2| Human 1: _do_ _you_ _have_ a favourite _flower ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: best [flower] [you] ever [have] , _i_ don't even know where _to_ start 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on a theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring to mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _it_ [does] [i'm] _pretty_ sure [the lotus] [flower] [spring to mind] 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ _research_ ! _just_ a personal theory . [i] _think that_ [flower] preferences _are more_ revealing _of_ _personality_ _than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: _what_ _does that_ [have] [to] [do] _with_ _it_ ? [i'm] [not] [the] [mind] [of] [research] . [just] people's [personality] [you] [think] [are more] interesting [than] others 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's_ _like_ a cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with] a crayon _and_ then [it] _came to life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: ay [it] [like] [you] _with the_ [more] [and] people's [not] [that] ? [the] [flower] [came to life] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone [what] their favourite [flower] is . [pretty] much [like] [what] we [just] _did_ . [does that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [you] [did] [it's] [what] [you] [think that] [it] [does] [make sense] , [just] [like] . [flower ?] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop a [sense] [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2:  ... [like] ? 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's a wonderful idea !
