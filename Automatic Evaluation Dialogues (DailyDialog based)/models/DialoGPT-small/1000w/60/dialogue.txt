Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	I am not your buddy, guy! It's good day to you, pal!
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	Have you went rock climbing yourself? How was your weekend?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	I went rock climbing with the movie about the Russian witch's mother. It was great What about YOU?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	Were they all the same movie that day and was your favorite?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	If it's dark and they can be out all the time when you go climbing over that rock?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	That'd prefer winter?
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	hahahah I actually not here was like you'd be visit Australia.
