Human 1:	 Hi.
Human 2:	 Helloooooo!
Human 1:	 How are you? How is your day?
Human 2:	Happy you are a day late to your party. How are you?
Human 1:	 I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.
Human 2:	Happy day you are! How about today? I'm very happy the day before your birthday. Happy Birthday!
Human 1:	 Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?
Human 2:	You know you have been positive for quite sometime when your Blue's happy. It would've been the same for everyone else.
