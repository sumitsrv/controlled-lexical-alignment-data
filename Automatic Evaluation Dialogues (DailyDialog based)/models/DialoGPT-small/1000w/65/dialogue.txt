Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I am going to go get ice cream.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	No moped this morning so the shop's going way down and my tires broke
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	Yes and diesel this morning... I work so that's why the mechanic broke down lol. How long does your moped have the tank now?
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Haha sounds good.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	Well your record the last 4 years but they don't think so lol good game btw
