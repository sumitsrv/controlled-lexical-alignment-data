Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	The scenario I've been pondering is someone would help you do what you need to do...
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	It's all been good for the like now I've invited myself friend right now with my other partner and have been pondering for years.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I hope not like they already
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A from friends are all out already's for help.
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	A for balance.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	A for single but I'm not single. Lol
