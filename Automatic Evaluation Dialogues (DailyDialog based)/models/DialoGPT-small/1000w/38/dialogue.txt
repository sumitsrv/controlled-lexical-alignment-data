Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	There's always bots you just need to set up like human chat to be able to be used for the same thing.
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	There have been some great progress over the last few years so I think you made some good progress, like bots
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	Well you have made some progress over the last few years. Like impersorsination sounds far fetched xd
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	good bots are good now
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛

Human 2:	LAST good bots can be better! now the far more and already start auto'ing like monolog
