A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about _human_ _like_ _chat_ _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: there's always [bots] [you] just need _to_ set up [like] [human] [chat] _to_ _be_ able _to_ _be_ used for _the_ same thing . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have made _some_ great progress over_ _last few years ._ do [you] _think_ [the] positives outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: there [have] been [some great progress over] [the] [last few years] _so_ _i think_ [you] [made some] _good_ [progress] , [like] [bots] 
A|6| Human 1: _like impersorsination_ ? though it _sounds far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: well [you] [have made some] [progress over] [the] [last few years .] [like impersorsination] [sounds far fetched] xd 
A|8| Human 1: true that ! [some] of these _bots are_ very engaging _and_ funny . they _are_ _now_ [good] at even sarcasm [i] wonder how [far] _are_ we from [the] time these [bots] _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [good] [bots are] [good] [now] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] it _can_ take many different forms as a product . [the] research implication is also huge ! it will signify how ai research has progressed [so] [far] _and_ _better_ place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: u ? 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [last] [good] [bots] [can] [be] [better] ! [now] [the] [far] [more] [and] [already] [start] auto'ing [like] monolog 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having this conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [last] [good] [bots] [can] [be] [better] ! [haha]
