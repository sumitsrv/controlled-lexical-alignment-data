Human 2:	Yeah but what happened there?
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	I will never forget that end touching the only time you watched the final bit.
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	Yes it's end touching that the ending only happened because of you will never forget what happens next
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	It's not the ending but it will spoil happy ending much. I didn't want you watch that end because of how you won't enjoy it.
Human 1:	 Thanks!
