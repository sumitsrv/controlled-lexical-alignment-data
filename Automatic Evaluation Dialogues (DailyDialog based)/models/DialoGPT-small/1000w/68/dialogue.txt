Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	i was able to understand some concepts last week, you're not the only one.
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	well you have the best time right now, this was a few lectures not able to understand some concepts last week
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?

Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	i have test time right now
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
