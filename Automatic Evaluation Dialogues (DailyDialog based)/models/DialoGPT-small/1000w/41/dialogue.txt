Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	Are you new? Lol.Lol.No. Are people too many?
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	No you can't, you know there's too many people out there who believe in miracles
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	S you... and not gone through the good?
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	You have electricity growing what about you and not growing too much Lol now
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	I empathise
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	Money and things people have money
