Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hey you!! What about you?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	Do you still won? It's amazing that I did for just once but it wasn't very much, great game OP!
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I just won your game I'm about to get you that's for sure but you still thank you very much
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	Racco
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	There's two cage match like tournaments I'm guessing that you won?
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	A cage match and it's for tennis sounds really fun!
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
