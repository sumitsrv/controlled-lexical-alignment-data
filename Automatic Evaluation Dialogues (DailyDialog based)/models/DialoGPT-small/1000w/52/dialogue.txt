Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Oh that is good for our cold weather! Its the jacket for its cold walk ability!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	It was nice out for a cold walk before the winter weather.
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
