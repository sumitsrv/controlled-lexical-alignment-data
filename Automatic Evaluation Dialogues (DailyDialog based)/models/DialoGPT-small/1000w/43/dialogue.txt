Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	This is the first cycle this cycle I'm participating in
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	I don't find mentorship useful at all either
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	I have signed up this time so you are good!
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	: 1 you are good. but yeah sometimes it works well
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	I have them but you'll have to plan things out well other than my 1:1 mentor
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	I have you tagged with your username as mentor. Very cool!
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
