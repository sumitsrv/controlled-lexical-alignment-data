Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	Oh you don't have the screen with me? It's on the screen. Where are you?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	I dance you a dance every night when I'm gone
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	I was not schwasty, she's just a regular one that you have to deal with!
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	I'm a real American doctor. You're going private practice? I'm sorry.
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	Are you private practice? I'm not sure if I know what that is and I can't be more specific.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	Well I'm a real doctor, not a private practice but that's an interesting job too.
