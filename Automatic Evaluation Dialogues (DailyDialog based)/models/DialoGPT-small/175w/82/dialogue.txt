Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hi. Whats up?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	It's been a few days, you? How about yourself?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	Yeah good for you man! Do you like it very good taste haha? How's it taste from Peru?
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	I just live one day at a time but that's probably not enough haha.
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	I would be nice but not quite that haha
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	I think after you just die your memory will start functioning normally..
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	No it will not be easy at all you just will live but the task is not the best.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
