Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	What holidays do you get to meet people?
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	How many people do you meet to keep count?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	what was the country where you met her?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	Did your people's lives matter to them and what about how you met her?
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	Do you mean you are people?
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	I think it's borderline spooky. It's an event that has been happening from people's lives and what's going on that makes it mildly interesting
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	It's a bit spooky, but you can still see it and treasure in them. That's what is interesting.
