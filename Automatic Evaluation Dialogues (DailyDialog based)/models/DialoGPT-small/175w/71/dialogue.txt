Human 2:	I'm sad for some reason I can't even see what project you're working on.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	That's some kind of angry sad. I'm sorry I lost you...
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	You're so mad. I hope your day was great.
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
