Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?

Human 2:	That's good. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?

Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	What's up? I'm on a fishing expedition.
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?

Human 2:	I'm going to a very nice local fishing camp and its in a sea country. I'm just over there.
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	You
