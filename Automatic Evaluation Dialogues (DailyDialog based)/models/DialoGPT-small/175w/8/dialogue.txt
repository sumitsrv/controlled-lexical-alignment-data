Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	I don't have time today.
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	Yes I should be out for the game with you all week
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	Will you have some game on in the next week? I should be out too with all my best mates
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	No I have plans for this week
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Yup. Hawaii.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	This place is so important. It's like the best beaches in California you could get for a day
