Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hi. I'm great.How about you?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	Hi.I win a million dollars, but I'm still taking credit for it.What about you?
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	You win for best game of the month :D
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I like racquetball so I'm guessing that's a favourite.
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	I'm game too.What's it like in your house? Does it get physical?
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	I like tennis and sport. I'm currently living in a cage.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
