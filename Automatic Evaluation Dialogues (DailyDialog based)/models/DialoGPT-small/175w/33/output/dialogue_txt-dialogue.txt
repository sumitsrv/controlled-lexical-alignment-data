B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's great , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn _how_ _to_ _make_ croissants . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] happy you're _not_ croissantdater [how] do _i_ [make] _me_ _a_ croissant ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done them_ once or twice _so_ far , _but_ _they_ _haven't_ _been_ flakey enough . [i'm] _trying to figure out_ _why_ . what kind of cookies _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [how] [you] [make] [them] ? [i've] [been] [trying to figure out] [how] [they] are [made] [but] [haven't] [done them] yet ... [why] ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: well _i_ [haven't] [made] [them] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] _good_ idea . i'll give it [a] _try_ next time . would [you] _say_ [you] _have_ [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [try] 
A|10| Human 1: some people don't ! [but] yeah , [me] _too_ , [i] think i'd eat _pastries all_ _the_ time if [i] could get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [so] you'd [say] [that] they're [good] !! [i] [have] [been] eating [pastries all] day [with] [the] chocolate _and_ milk [too] . 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort of stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [you] . jpg :d 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
