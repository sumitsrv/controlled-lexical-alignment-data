Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hi and welcome back
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	Hi and welcome! I'm your new best friend! What are you doing this friday? I can't tell if I have a class on that
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Hahahhaa I see you there too! What class?
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	I like tea
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	you make tea? :D
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	No but I also like tea : o How are you from the nether
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	I also like white teas. And all kinds of stuff.
