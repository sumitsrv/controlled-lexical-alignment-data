A|8| Human 1: me too . [now i] have folks come visit me [for the holidays] ! but _that's_ also tiresome .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i know] [that's] why [you] [want [to stay] home] [for the holidays] 
A|10| Human 1: yes ! we set _up_ an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas tree_ [and] put _up_ some _colorful_ led _lights_ which is very festive .

A|12| Human 1: buying [a] [tree] is [a] neat experience . [i was] torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one [that] smells _like_ fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for the] one [that] we can disassemble every year . 
B|13| Human 2: it's 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , very clever pun ! _i like_ it ! depends . [i] remember having real [christmas] _trees_ from childhood , but these days [with] climate change , [i] think not chopping down [a] [tree] [just] [to] decorate it [and] then throw it out in [a] month is [the] more responsible thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [for] [tree] 
A|16| Human 1: admit my favorite _store_ is _target_ , plus they often have good deals . 
B|17| Human 2: [i like] [trees] . [target] [store] ?
