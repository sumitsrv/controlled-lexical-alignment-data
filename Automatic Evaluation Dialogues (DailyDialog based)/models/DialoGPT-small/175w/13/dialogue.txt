Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I feel like the Parasite meme is dead at this point.
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	What did you end up watching last weekend?
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	This weekend I did the Mandalorian! It was amazing.
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	I did the same last weekend lol I really wanted a Marvel and Star Wars
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	I can't watch the movie too. I want to be Spiderman and think I'll see the movies myself. This was really scary
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I think the actor is good
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	It was good, I liked Loki too haha
