A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: how about [flower] art ? _i_ [have a] few ideas _i_ would love _to_ paint . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ [a] _theory ._ why does _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [the lotus] [flower] [theory] [i'm working on] . _what_ other art ? 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ _research_ ! just [a] _personal_ _theory ._ _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences _are_ more revealing of personality than _people_ _appreciate_ . 
B|7| Human 2: [the] [flower] [theory] [that] [are] [the] [people] [i think] would [appreciate] art . but [not] for [it's] own [personal] [research] . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if _you_ drew "flower" with [a] crayon _and_ then _it_ _came_ [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [came] for [the] [flower] [theory .] [you] [like] [it] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone [what] their favourite [flower] is . pretty much [like] [what] we just did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [you] [like] [it] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person some more _, and_ ask them some more questions _, and_ gradually develop [a] sense of [what] they're [like] , over [the] course of maybe two [to] five years . _and_ voila 
B|13| Human 2: [a] [, and] [like] [the] best 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
