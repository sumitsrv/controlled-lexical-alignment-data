Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	The secret has been out long enough. Now they need to get it in the microkitchen.
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	A jacket that has some padding on the front and back would be awesome.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	It makes me feel good that I am out in cold weather even now.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Yeah, it's great, the cold weather here is even better
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	It's the New York of europe! Nice weather, good schools!
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Oh you know it. I remember last time the UK got a big shipment out too.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	Oh and there is one of our desk too if you can find out
