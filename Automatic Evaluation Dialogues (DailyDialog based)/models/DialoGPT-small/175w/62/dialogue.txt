Human 2:	My son is like you, I don't care What does your son say he says?
Human 1:	 I'm taking a fake sick day from work so I can go to the movies.
Human 2:	I'm taking a day from work so I can't really be bothered for the whole day.
Human 1:	 Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.
Human 2:	I like the movies myself just to make
Human 1:	 Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone. What's your favorite movie?
Human 2:	My son always said the movies don't have to be with me
Human 1:	 Get out of town! It's Avatar too. What are the odds!?
