Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	I've actually been considering that as something I could practice for a while. How do you think you'd get there?
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	Aww that's great, and I was born with one and have since been a little bit bigger, haha!
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
