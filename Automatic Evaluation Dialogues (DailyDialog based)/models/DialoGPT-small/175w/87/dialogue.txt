Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	Hey there you are! what are you doing up here? I'm in New Britain, AMA Edit : i'm not you are i'm just here
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	Yeah you and I are in the same boat. I'm enjoying the book as well and reading it now.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	It sounds like you are enjoying it. I'm reading book 3
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	Nope I can't read.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	I've read and it's like books but with more innovation
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	Is it about the philosophy of the book you want to
Human 1:	 yup!
