Human 2:	My party was Turkey Turkeys. I ate the turk.
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	That was funny... But I thought you were going to eat Turkey Turkeys!!
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	I got it from home in Turkey, they were on a party boat. But I did cook the turk, you are correct.
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	Turkey was not turkey.
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	I did have fun games with turkey
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	i like ball. fun.
