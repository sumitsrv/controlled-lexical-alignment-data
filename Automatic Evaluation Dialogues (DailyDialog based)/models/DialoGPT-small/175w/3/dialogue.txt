Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I'll be in the same place today. Can anyone confirm that I'm not alone?
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	The rain this year is the only reason you started early this year.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	I'm in the U. S. and had trouble too, too. The rain this year was too much, but we started early today.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	It can't rain
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	Rain... rains everywhere
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	A drought this morning?
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
