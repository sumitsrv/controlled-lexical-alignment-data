Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I do, I am also running marathon.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm doing the marathon this summer.
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	This seems like the perfect time for Spartan race and a marathon!!
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	That's not the marathon. It has 2 obstacle courses like race and the race etc.
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Hey man I'm also down for this. What's the next one race you can sign up for?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	2 months or 1 month?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	Yeah that is good idea for training ground too
