Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	He was actually there and I went home to do my first roller coaster ride!
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Oh that's good? You think that was scary?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet.
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	Oh wow! I'm not the most technical but I trust the engineering lol
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	Oh wow! I'm glad it's done.
