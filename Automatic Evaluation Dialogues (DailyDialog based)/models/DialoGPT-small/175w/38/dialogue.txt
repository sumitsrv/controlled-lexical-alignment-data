Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	I like chat bots youtubers.
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	You can have some progress over the last few years. I'm here for you.
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	It sounds very far fetched
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	I have the same reaction from bots like that even though it sounds good
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	This might
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	I think so, I will be using that next time lol
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	Oh good you like this haha, well I will take another one
