A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about human _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [like chat bots] youtubers . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed to _have_ made _some_ great _progress over_ _last few years ._ do _you_ _think_ _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [you] _can_ [have] [some] [progress over] [the] [last few years .] i'm _here_ for [you] . 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? _though it sounds_ _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [it sounds] _very_ [far fetched] 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] of these [bots] are [very] engaging and funny . they are now _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how [far] are we _from_ [the] _time_ these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [have] [the] same reaction [from] [bots] [like] [that] [even] [though it sounds] [good] 
A|10| Human 1: _i think_ [it] [can] _take_ many different forms as a product . [the] research implication is also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai research has progressed _so_ [far] and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might_ _be_ overselling [it] [here] 😛 
B|11| Human 2: _this_ [might] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [so] , [i] [will] [be] using [that] next [time] lol 
A|14| Human 1: _haha ,_ pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having [this] conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: oh [good] [you] [like] [this] [haha ,] well [i] [will] [take] another one
