Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hello from r all. How's the new year?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Well that's unfortunate. How did your test go?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	The Civil War didn't start until the 1860's, so it's not that far off, and no one has to fight for them.
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	Well yeah you know what else you didn't want it right? History
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I work with the Civil War : History section... you know. What do ya do!?
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	It was one horse.
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	No you won't. Just kidding, I think my job has pretty cool people.
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	My job doesn't even require you to win money... just you win it
