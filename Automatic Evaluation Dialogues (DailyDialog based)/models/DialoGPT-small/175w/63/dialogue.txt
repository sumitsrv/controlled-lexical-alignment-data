Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	You know... you're the kind of person and what i wish for... a trip with you would be great!
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	Yes yes and yes, you will know the Disneyland Disney trip will be great if you have the kids for fun and are willing to stay for a long
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Yikes.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	Yes, that.Yes.that will.yeshough
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	I would think that about any holiday in the year.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	If this is your year old account you are safe to take this for the rest of the years!
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	As in Lego legos.in?
