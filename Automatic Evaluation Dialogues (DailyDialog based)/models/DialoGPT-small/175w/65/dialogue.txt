Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm going to go eat some Chinese food now.
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	I'm so tired and I work today. How's your day going?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	It's diesel but the engine that runs is not.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Yes, you
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Sure, I'll drive home today and catch the Warriors games tonight. It's been fine here btw
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	You can't refute their record
