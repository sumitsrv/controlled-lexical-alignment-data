Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	Thanksgiving has been great for pumpkin pie, but Christmas is a great holiday!

Human 2:	Pumpkin pie and pumpkin for the family with you!
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	I would love pumpkin pie, but if you want pumpkin pie for christmas then yeah.. that could work.
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
