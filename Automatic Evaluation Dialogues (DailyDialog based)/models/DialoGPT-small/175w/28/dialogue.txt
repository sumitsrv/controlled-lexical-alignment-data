Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	Hey what was the breakfast you ate? I'm in the kitchen just had a bite of delicious toast right after class!
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	I ate breakfast yesterday and I'm eating breakfast and a hash brown tomorrow. What did I do today?
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	That's true. Eating breakfast and watching TV all day
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	Food.
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	I love the way you think.
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	I like how you think. I eat a BRILLi ion and I don't feel a need to get out of bed.
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
