Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 How was the trip last weekend?
Human 2:	Well the last trip was a couple weeks ago so that would not be a good thing :P
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	Thanks! I cover all the big places, most of the big cities, especially the outskirts like Pisa.
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	Ah, what you do at the moment is cooking.
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	I like it with pasta, but also some zucchini. But mostly cooking :P
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	I hope to join this team next week.
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	Thanks for the invite.
