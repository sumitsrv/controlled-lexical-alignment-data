Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hey there.
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm back! How are you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	No its on a movie channel, so we are the same with watching it live.
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	Hokey is the best. Hokey kochy. That's how you watch it.
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	Is this the UFC's live training tournament?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I'm so hyped
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	You will be competing on this weekend and you should!
