Human 2:	What about me? You won't see me if you don't answer me.
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	How would you compare this with the fMRI machine that was for you and I did. You can trust us, because we know your secret.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	What brain activity thing?
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	So this isn't that brain activity thing. But you believe in Science!?
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
