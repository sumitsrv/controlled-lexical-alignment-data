Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Oh hey, your the other person's dad. How was the day?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	No, you can't. Ehhh so how's your moped broke down the morning?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I am that mechanic so the way I said this out now is very confusing lol
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	I'll do the drive now.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	I will catch the game this night
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	I think you're the first person I see in this thread that doesn't believe in your faith
