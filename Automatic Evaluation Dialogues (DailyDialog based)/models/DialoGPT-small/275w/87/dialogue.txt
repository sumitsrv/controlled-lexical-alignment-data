Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	Any books that you read for sleep? like I'm reading Zero to One
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	What's it about? I like that stuff but for the most part I'm looking to read
