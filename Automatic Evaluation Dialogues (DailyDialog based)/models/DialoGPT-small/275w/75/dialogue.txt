Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	Oh you have the same face in that screenshot, where's that?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	I've seen you online before and have a very similar dance style
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	I don't think you could have been in the exact same room as me together. Lol
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	You have been watching football for the past 3 hours, I'm guessing you've been watching the cardiologist's practice.
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	You have a private practice? I'm not sure what that is.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	A real cardiologist job that I'm sure you have been looking for. You're welcome.
