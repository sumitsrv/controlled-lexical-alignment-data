Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	This is the first time I have been able to finish a marathon. :D
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm planning on getting my marathon medal this year :D
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	What the heck you doing in Spartan race? Are they challenging? It's not like you could see the whole race and time?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	What's the obstacle race like?
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	Do it! I'll sign you up for next race and see you at Spartan's!
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	How long you workout for?
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I am for the next one. I'm also training with a few other people and can practice as well.
