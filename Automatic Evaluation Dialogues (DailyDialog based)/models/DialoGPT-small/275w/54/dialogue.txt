Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hello how you doong lt 3 hope it was nice talk, good game and good luck
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	did you win on game day? I'm kind of wondering about that
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	I love you for taking that bet I'm not very good and but this game's kind amazing. Haha
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	What
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	It's like that game in racquetball with cage animals
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	It's really fun though I'm playing it for the first time and it sounds like an experience.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
