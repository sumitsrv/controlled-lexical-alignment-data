Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	What about you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	A friend who had a friend like this, wow... It was the last time you saw him. Good luck.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	I was like this the last time you were with it. It had been long and you'd say wow. When you were going I'd make fun
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	Ohh it was a long time ago.. you do?
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	Sounds like fun adventures for you
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	Hmmmm, like you want that bull
