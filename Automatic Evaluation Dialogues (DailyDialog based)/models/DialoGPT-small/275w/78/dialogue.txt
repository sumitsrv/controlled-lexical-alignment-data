Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	What's your dream job?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	I'm not psychic but I'm pretty sure that was my guess.
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	I'm guessing you're a chef! I have the ability to feel how and what not!
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	What did you
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	I dance for work. What can I say?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	Yeah I have very nice work! But wow the day is so nice I like you and make cake for all
