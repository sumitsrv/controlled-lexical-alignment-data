Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	I'm sad I have to miss her. She was my girl in high school.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	Oh I'm sad for her, it'll be great when you get here and I just miss your catfood dish.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I would miss you and your catfood dish.If you could just go anywhere
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	... zipline?? you can?
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	I'm just going to zipline there. I can't imagine what you'll be scared about.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	i should make one.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	I should make one and then zipline it mate!
