Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	It's like the youtube video creation is going to be a problem for people.
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	Oh wow, I just checked the download for it and it's really great. Definitely gonna use it this time around :D
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	It's the music you use for the creation, it's pretty cool. It's just going to be a few days before I start writing.
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	Thanks for listening, I've been listening too haha
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	I think you are the first artist on this subreddit with a guitar
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	Are you the bar chords for this guitar?
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	So you can't write words though like the bar chords for long time's?
