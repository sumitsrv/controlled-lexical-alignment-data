B|3| Human 2: congrats _you_ ! [it's great] [to] be here ! [i'm] _a_ croissant fan myself . _have a_ wonderful night ! 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done them once or twice so far , but _they haven't been flakey enough_ . [i'm] _trying_ [to] figure out why . what kind of _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [they haven't been flakey enough] , [have you] ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [they] [have] [been] flaked _and_ [haven't been] [made] yet . 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] good _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try next time . would [you] say [you] [have a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i've] [been] eating [cookies] 
A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ ! but yeah , me _too_ , _i_ _think_ i'd _eat_ pastries _all_ _the_ time if _i_ could _get_ away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: my mom _and_ [i] [all] [eat] [cookies] [with] butter , _that's the_ [idea] [you] [get] [people] [that] [don't] , they'd [think] your [trying] [too] hard 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort of stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] _fat_ substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: mmmah ... [fat] ups . 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
