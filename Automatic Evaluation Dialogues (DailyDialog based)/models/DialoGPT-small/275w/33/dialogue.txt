Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	Congrats you! It's great to be here! I'm a croissant fan myself. Have a wonderful night!
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	They haven't been flakey enough, have you?
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	They have been flaked and haven't been made yet.
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	I've been eating cookies
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	My mom and I all eat cookies with butter, that's the idea you get people that don't, they'd think your trying too hard
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	Mmmah... fat ups.
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
