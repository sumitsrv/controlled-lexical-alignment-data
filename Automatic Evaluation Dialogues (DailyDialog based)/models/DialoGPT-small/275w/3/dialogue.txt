Human 2:	How bad are our injuries today? I've been pretty sick for 2 days

Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	That's the only bad thing that this season, too. They had like, water trouble, and lots of rain today

Human 2:	So that can't be too much rain
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
