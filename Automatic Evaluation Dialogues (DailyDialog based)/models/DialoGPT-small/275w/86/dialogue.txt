Human 2:	We have been here for a while, you know, Uganda
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	Where were you going to go? Are you from around Africa?
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	So you traveled around Europe? How did you get the volunteer project?
