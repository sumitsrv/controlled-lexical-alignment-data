Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	I won't see you. You're the superman.
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	But this wouldnt be any less useless if you used the fMRI machine and not the machine learning. What about you?
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	What's an imaging thing
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
