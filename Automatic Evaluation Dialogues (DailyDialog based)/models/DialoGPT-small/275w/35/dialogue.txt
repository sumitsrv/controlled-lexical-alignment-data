Human 2:	What subject are you studying?
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	Wait what high school? I'm in high school right now and was working on Biology today
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	Well I'm studying Biology.
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	Yeah I think your right.
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	That's something that can practice? I'm not a surgeon.
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	I have that with mine. I can't imagine one without a brain though. And you can practice things
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	I have that too and its pretty cool, I even enjoy med school. I can't stand this though.
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
