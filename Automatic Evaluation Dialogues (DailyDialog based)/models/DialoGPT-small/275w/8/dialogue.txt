Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Hi u ryanjames
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	I know I'm out for the whole season too with all the teams
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	How have you been this year? I'm out for the entire year too with only a few players left
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	I'm out for the next 2 weeks
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Holla for Hawaii
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	It's important, I'm getting it for the whole day. California beaches have been like this for months.
