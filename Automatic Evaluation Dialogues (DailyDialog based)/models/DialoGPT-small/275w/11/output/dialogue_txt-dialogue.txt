A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ a favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [have] [you] tagged _as_ likes _to_ [flower] 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ a _theory_ . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: yeah [i'm working on] [theory] [the lotus] [does] [have] _more_ light compared [to] [the] regular one 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ _research_ ! _just_ a personal [theory] . _i think_ _that_ [flower] _preferences are_ [more] revealing of _personality than_ people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm working on] [that] [research] now , [i think] [it's not] [more] [personality than] [preferences are] [the] better option . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ a cartoon _flower ._ [as] if [you] drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [research] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone _what_ their favourite [flower] is . pretty much _like what_ we _just_ did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: d'es [you] [think] ? [i'm] [just] [like what] ? [the] [flower .] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] person some [more] , and ask them some [more] questions , and gradually develop a sense of [what] they're [like] , _over the_ course of maybe _two_ [to] five _years_ . and voila 
B|13| Human 2: you're [over the] [two] [years] ? 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's a wonderful idea !
