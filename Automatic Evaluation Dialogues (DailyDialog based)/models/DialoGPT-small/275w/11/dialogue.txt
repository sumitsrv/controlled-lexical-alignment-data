Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	I have you tagged as Likes to flower
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	Yeah I'm working on theory the lotus does have more light compared to the regular one
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	I'm working on that research now, I think it's not more personality than preferences are the better option.
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	Research
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	D'es you think? I'm just like what? The flower.
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	You're over the two years?
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
