B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect _back_ too much on things , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been_ very favorable for me in terms of time spent _with family_ _and_ _friends and work life balance_ . why _do_ [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _what_ _year_ [and] [with] whom [you] [work] [with] ? _what_ [have] [you] [been] told [back] _to_ your [family] [friends and work life balance] ? 
A|4| Human 1: _great !_ good idea [to] help _people_ figuring _out_ their _new_ [year] _resolutions_ 🙂 so how _do_ _i_ _get_ a fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [get] [out] [and] [do] [work life balance] [with family] , [people] [you] [have been] [friends] [with] [and] your [new] [resolutions] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! _sounds_ amazing if we practice that ! _i think_ [the] idea does [have] some potential . how did [you] come up [with] [this] idea ? 
B|7| Human 2: hahahahahahha . 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great !_ [this] is valuable help for [the] community . _i think_ mental health is one of [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [sounds] [great !] 
A|10| Human 1: that is actually a quote stolen from my tl when _i_ joined my first company after graduation . _i_ guess now after 5 yrs of [work] experience , _i_ fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: haha , [great] [work] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; _i think_ [family] [and] [friends] play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] _stuff_ 3 . multiple hobbies that keep [you] busy ... so on 🙂 [what] _about you_ ? is there a right answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [about you] ... [this] [stuff] ...?

A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually not much of a reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂
