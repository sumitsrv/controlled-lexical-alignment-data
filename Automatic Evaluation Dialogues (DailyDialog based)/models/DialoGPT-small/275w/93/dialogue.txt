Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	Yeah you are really good this time of year
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	Ahh it's called Canada?
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	Yup and done
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
