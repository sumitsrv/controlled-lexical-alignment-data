A|4| Human 1: oh , [i] would love [to] _twiddle_ my _thumbs_ _. you're_ so _lucky_ ! today , i've _been_ mostly attending meetings , reading _and_ writing docs , reading papers etc . 
B|5| Human 2: no [i] think [your] [been] _a_ [twiddle] [your] [thumbs] [and] [your] [thumbs] _are_ _just_ _going to_ sit down [. you're] [lucky] . _that's_ not _too_ bad .
