Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	Ah you can't watch Marvel movies and Spiderman haha
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	I think the actor and that other guy can really pull it off haha
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	The other guy was Loki and that was the only actor I was really impressed haha
