Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	Hi I'm Alex. What about you Alex?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	Do you play with friends? What's the game about?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	Have you played Pokemon I'm thinking about getting a Switch Would recommend
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	I would recommend it. I get into Pokemon but like to play with friends.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
