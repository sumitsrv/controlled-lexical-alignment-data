Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hi there!
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	Good day, good day. I'm going to watch basketball, that's about it.

Human 2:	Oh the Haha ha'la that is.
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	That was scary. Ahh the halo that can shoot bullets. I'd heard of Wall and E about this movie once.
