Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	How are they giving out goodies
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	What did the jacket say when he heard they were giving out some goodies?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	It's cold out and the jacket says that our family has been at extreme temperatures for months! :D How are you?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	I'm so so sorry for you! Where did you live before the cold weather?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Where did you live before?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	Well for the last time they won't!! I guess our next thing is some goodies!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	What can you get there and your desk.
