Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	It's good that you are thankful for my existence.
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	I have plans for you, my mom and my sister are coming out.
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	Yeah this place really has interesting people
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	Yeah it's good food though
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	I think the place was for you
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	I don't know any Japanese people that are in and attend other conferences all year long
