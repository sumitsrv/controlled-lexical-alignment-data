Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	What scenario? I've been pondering about this for a few days.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	You have been invited for lunch with the friend? I feel like they are all not good because that's so awkward
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	I lose friends
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	A friend's texts from friends.
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	So what's it like to be the balance?
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I'm single and I feel the right balance. It's not the same for all but that doesn't mean it should not be used though.
