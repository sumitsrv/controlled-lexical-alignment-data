Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	How's the sun? You're beautiful... he says in a calm tone.
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	The beach's coming in! she laughs You know you need it! He laughs and the sun rises.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	he nods Hahaha you got that idea! You need the beach!
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	It's beachhaha you need your work some fish to the sun hahah
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	ahaha This is very interesting.
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	ahaha Sounds like the same XD?
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	haha that's pretty funny I have never gone outside and did actually lol
