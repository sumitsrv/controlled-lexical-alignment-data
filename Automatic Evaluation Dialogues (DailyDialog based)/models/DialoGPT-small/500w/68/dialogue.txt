Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	I was not the attend, you help.
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	I think you should have this week right now. I'm not able to attend the lectures last time, but I can write some slides from this week
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	I can now have this week
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	I think this may not over the weekend?
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	The syllabus?
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	Well I had the latest course content that week, so I hope you like your next one well. This one was pretty cool for sure.
