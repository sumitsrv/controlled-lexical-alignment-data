Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	It's the way your moped broke down! Ehhhhhhh this is so weird and not a good day for work
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	What's the way that diesel mechanic is trying to figure out this morning? lol. It's getting down to your work now and moped broke.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Nahhhh that sounds good?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
