Human 2:	Are the near towns in Spain the ones you see in your dreams or are they the places you dream in dreams?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?

Human 2:	Haha thanks I'm not a great runner either! Hahaha! I like sports :P Have you tried any extreme lifts before?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?

Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Yea I'm the same, skiing
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
