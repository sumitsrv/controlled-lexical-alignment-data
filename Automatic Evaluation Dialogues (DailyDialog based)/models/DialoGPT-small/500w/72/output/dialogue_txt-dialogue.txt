B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ _reflect back too much on things_ , but _i_ guess 2019 _have been_ _very_ _favorable_ _for_ _me_ in terms of _time_ spent _with family and_ friends _and work life balance . why_ do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _this_ [and] [very] [much] [for] _some_ [time] [have been] [favorable] _to_ [me] [with family [and] work life balance . why] [don't] [you] [reflect back too much on things] ?

B|5| Human 2: [i] [have] [new year resolutions] [and] [people] [don't] care _about_ [how] [much] [time] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! _sounds_ amazing if we practice _that !_ [i] think [the] _idea_ does [have] [some] potential . [how] did [you] come up _with this_ _idea_ ?

A|10| Human 1: [that] is actually a quote stolen from my tl when [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs of [work] experience , [i] fully _agree with_ it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [agree [with] this] [too] [great] [idea] . 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] think [family and] friends play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... _so_ [on] 🙂 [what] [about] [you] ? is there a _right_ answer [to] [this] ? :)
