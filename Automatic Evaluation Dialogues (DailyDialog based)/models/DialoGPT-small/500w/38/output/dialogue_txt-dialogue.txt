A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what do you think about_ _human like_ _chat _bots_ ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ [you] _can_ get _it_ in [chat bots] anyway . not [human like] . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed to _have_ made some great _progress over last few_ years . _do you think_ _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [we] [have] [the] same [progress over last few] months . [what do you think about] them [bots ?] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination _? though it sounds far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: [what] [about] [it] ? [what] [about] [bots [?] though it sounds far fetched] . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! some of these [bots] are very engaging _and_ funny . they are now good at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how [far] are [we] _from_ [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2:  
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] _can take_ many different forms as _a_ _product_ . [the] research implication is also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai research has progressed so [far] _and_ better place to tackle more _futuristic_ problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already [do] _pretty_ good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: oh 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , _pretty_ [far fetched] 🙂 nice having _this conversation_ with _you !_ 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [will] say [that] [even] [you] [have] [a] [pretty] [futuristic] [and] [the] best [product] ! [i] [can take] [this conversation] [from] [you !] [haha]
