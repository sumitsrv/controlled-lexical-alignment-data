A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ [a] _theory_ . why does [the] lotus spring _to_ _mind_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm working on] [the] [theory] _i_ [have] in [mind] _that_ you've never had [a] _flower ._ 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not research_ ! just _a personal theory_ . _i think_ _that flower_ preferences _are more_ revealing of personality _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [it's not research] [it's] [a personal theory] [that] [i think] [people] [are more] [than] happy [to] [have] . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] like [a] cartoon [flower .] as [if] [you] _drew_ "flower" with [a] crayon _and_ then it came [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [that flower] [i] [drew] [you] [and] [life] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , _step_ 1 is [, you] ask someone _what_ their [favourite flower] is . pretty much like _what_ we just _did_ . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: ohay ? 
A|12| Human 1: cool . _step_ 2: talk with [the] person some [more] , [and] ask them some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense of _what_ they're like , over [the] course of maybe _two_ [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [step] [two] [and] [what] [you] [did] [i'm] [the] [flower] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
