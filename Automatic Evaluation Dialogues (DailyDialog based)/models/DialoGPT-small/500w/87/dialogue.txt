Human 2:	Well you seem pretty bored what are you doing today?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	Oh I'm reading the book. you are doing great over there.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	Well how's the book doing? you like that?
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	oh are you doing good that I read books about the book and what you like, how does it?
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	what's that book about? and how it is for you?
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	I'm being lazy
Human 1:	 yup!
