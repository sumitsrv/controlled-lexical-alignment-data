Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	I just wet my car.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	How much rain does the weather make today?
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	You don't like rain? We had a bad year too...
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	I think it's pretty gloomy today... the weather can't stay. Just that much rain. Haha
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	You people have never seen the water supply..
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	This weather
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
