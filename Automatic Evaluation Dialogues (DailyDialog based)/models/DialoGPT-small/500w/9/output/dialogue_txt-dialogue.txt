B|9| Human 2: _oh_ [that's] [just] [too] [bad] [but] [i] [stay] 
A|10| Human 1: yes ! we _set up_ an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas tree_ [and] put _up_ _some_ colorful led lights which is very _festive_ .

A|12| Human 1: buying [a] _tree_ is [a] neat experience . [i] was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs . [a] real one that smells like fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] one that we can disassemble every year . 
B|13| Human 2: it's [happy] . 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , very clever pun ! [i] like _it_ ! depends .
