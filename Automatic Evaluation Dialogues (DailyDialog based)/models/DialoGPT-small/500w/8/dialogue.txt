Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	No I'm too sick for this week the game has been chill out all day cause you should think about getting your flu cold with me
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	You sick I think you'll be chill.

Human 2:	Hey I have big plans for the whole week too, I'm sick. you? I'll goin '
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	what do you love?
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	A whole lotion for the day's worth it would have been a good time.
