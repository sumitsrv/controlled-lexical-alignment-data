Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	Welcome I'm great you are awesome
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	You can play anything you want.but you think? What about yourself with friends? I'm terrible at this game but fun for people to play together
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	What's it like getting into game play with others?
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	What book are you interested in?
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	I'm so so into good book's.
