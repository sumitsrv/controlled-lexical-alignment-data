Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	which one are you from where you get to meet people
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	What's your count? Hard to keep track of people who meet you on a regular basis
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	What was your count during the US one? Because we are still pretty well on track. Australia? Japan?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	I usually learn from it but what are people's count and when? The interactions are fascinating
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	That's what people mean when you call them are it coming and they're really short.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	Yeah it's what you'd call a spooky and interesting world. The people are just really short but it's still
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	It's the kind you'll find treasure in, but it's usually spooky and interesting
