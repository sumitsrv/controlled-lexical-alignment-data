Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	No problem, you?
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	Okay, bye bye sorry about that. I'm good after you.
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	Sure! just have you to think about some plans that will make sense when you are home. How would you like to go?
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	If you are out that is.
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	What's that city you are based out of and how do you like it there?
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	That's the one and last place I had to have flu. It wasn't that bad but it did get down.
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
