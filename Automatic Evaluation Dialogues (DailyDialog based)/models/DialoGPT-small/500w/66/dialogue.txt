Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	I marathon a day or two a week. I've ran 8 times a week since August for about three years now.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	I'm not planning to marathon any events right now but the months and months you see of your time.
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	Yeah you and your marathon days are like the only obstacle race in any marathons I see of yours, which's good
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	I like monkey bars and fun.
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	What the heck? Wanna join next one?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	2 months? good for you but the next one's in 1.5 months
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	I can practice for 1 month with the next training ground you mentioned.
