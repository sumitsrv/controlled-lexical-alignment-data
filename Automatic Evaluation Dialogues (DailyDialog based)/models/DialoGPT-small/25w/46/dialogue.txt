Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	I'll help. I think it's okay this happens all the time... I have an idea for a scenario though.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	What is the situation?
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	yes.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	You? You are avoiding social media?
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	I like the use of the word balance, but that's not what it was. It's a very good, useful example.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	I can't wait. I'm single too. And single in the car
