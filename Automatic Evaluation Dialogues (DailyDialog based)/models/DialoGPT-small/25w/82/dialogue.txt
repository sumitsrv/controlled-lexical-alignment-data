Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	Hey what's up?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Hey man, how're you doing today?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	I have a similar one in the same spot. I'm not sure if it's from Peru but it looks cool.
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	This was the first thing that came into my head as well. You guys have good taste.
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	You? lol
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	Oh. Yeah. I believe that would be the case if you were reincarnate
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	Well, the brain can't think of itself or think about itself. I think this would do the trick
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
