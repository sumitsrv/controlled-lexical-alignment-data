Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Nice to meet you! Is this your first time doing something like this?
Human 2:	I do this in public with my friends all the time.
Human 1:	 I have been with the company for over 3 years. Stick with the same team What about you?
Human 2:	I've been with the company for over a year. They don't care that the team have nothing to say about it, it's been about us
Human 1:	 That sounds like a perfect plan!
Human 2:	I think I can make it work! I have a team of four people and we have a lot of staff who could help if we feel like meeting
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	What about a meeting?
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	I can also use the menu
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
