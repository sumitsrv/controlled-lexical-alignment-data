Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	How's it going!?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	Where's your home town?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	You okay bud. Are you feeling okay?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	You must be an amazing athlete! Hahahaha I'm feeling pretty trepidatious right now and you're on a good streak, keep it
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	Are you into snowboarding or water skiing or running? I'm sure you will be able to find something
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	Very proud
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
