Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	Hey there.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	I have been. My day has been done.
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	I sometimes drift off during work and read books. It's like a dream.
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	I'm so glad you do things for me. How have you been?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	I went all the places you have and you were just fine
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	Why are you flying?
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	It's not like I can fly that far and I can swim
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	I have money...
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
