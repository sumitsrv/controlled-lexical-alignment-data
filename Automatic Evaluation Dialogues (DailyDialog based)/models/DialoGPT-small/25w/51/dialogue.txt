Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	Good day! How about yourself?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	You can also put down money you like to put down and enjoy the fun!
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	My favorite part of fishing is the fish.
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	No plans for weekend, but I will have to do something soon once I'm in town
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	Yeah they do a lot of the fishing over seas. Its super fun in the summer.
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	Yeah New York
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	Oh!
