Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	But there's a video with the machine learning on. It's not that simple.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	But what was your brain imaging you did?
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	I believe you're thinking of Science for the intelligent, not the silly :P
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	You don't believe in science? Science is your lord and saviour and god?
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
