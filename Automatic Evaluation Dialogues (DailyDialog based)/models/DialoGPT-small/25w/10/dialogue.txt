Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Hey there.
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	Oooh, that sounds good.
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	It's pretty cool how the Civil War ended up being a victory for everyone.
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	I know, you're right... I'm actually really enjoying watching the civil war stuff.
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	I just do the research, I don't do anything
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	It's a great book. I've read about it a couple times, the one I was a horse is by the same author.
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	Yes, a friend of mine, and I've been thinking about it a lot of times.
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	Yes, I'm the owner. I got a horse there. It's my dream job.
