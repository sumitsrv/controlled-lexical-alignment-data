Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	I'm here! : 3
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	Oh. Oh. How's everyone doing?
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	I'm just here to watch a basketball game I don't really care about.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	I'd call them The NYer
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	Nerp. I'm not the best at naming my team, sorry!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	You have won the internet. Thanks! :D
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	oh you.
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	I thought that was about the time a bunch of people were trying to find out who the most evil AI is.
