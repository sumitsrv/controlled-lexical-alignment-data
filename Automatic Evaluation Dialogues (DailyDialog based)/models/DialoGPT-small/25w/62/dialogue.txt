Human 2:	 hi there! it's a lovely day to chat with you
Human 1:	 Isn't it just! What are you up to today?
Human 2:	Is it just me or are you all sounding slightly like some kind of... bot?
Human 1:	 Oh, excellent! What does your son like to do for fun?
Human 2:	You are a great son!
Human 1:	 I'm taking a fake sick day from work so I can go to the movies.
Human 2:	You son sounds like you're about to get a real sick day
Human 1:	 Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.
Human 2:	You have such a big time list to pick from. If you don't like movies, I highly recommend watching movies by yourself.
Human 1:	 Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone. What's your favorite movie?
Human 2:	Well the first two movies are great.But I don't have time for movies.
Human 1:	 Get out of town! It's Avatar too. What are the odds!?
Human 2:	What are the odds?
Human 1:	 Yes. Can't wait for the sequels.
