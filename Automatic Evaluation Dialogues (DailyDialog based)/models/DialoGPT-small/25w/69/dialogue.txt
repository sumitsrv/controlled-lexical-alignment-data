Human 2:	You've had too much turk?
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	No, we got a party.
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	We had a party at home, they had turkey.
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	We do not celebrate Thanksgiving, but we eat turkey in the oven on the weekends. We share with Thanksgiving family.
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	I had no games in this family.
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	Fun.
