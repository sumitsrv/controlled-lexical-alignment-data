Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	I am going in the micro kitchen.
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	What jacket do you guys wear the most? I'm going in the cold. Looks like you need a jacket!
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	Are you feeling cold this time?!? Or is your jacket a cold jacket?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	Yea, I live out here for a day
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	Y'all? Haha you live in New York right?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	You should have seen when they ran out
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	I can just take your place, I guess that's enough to walk there.
