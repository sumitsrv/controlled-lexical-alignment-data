Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Hate to be that guy, but it's The Parasite. Not this guy. And I'm sure that's just a joke.
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	I know I'm alone! I was looking for a movie I haven't seen in years.
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	Mandalorian! What's it good for!?
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	I have a feeling that the Marvel movies are gonna be awesome.
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	That was the best Spiderman movie since.
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	No the actor who is playing Miles is good looking but not very good and it was a huge mistake.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	The guy playing Loki is very good looking, but not that good.
