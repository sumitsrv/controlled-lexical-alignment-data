Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	Hello. How's it going?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	I won it at the game yesterday.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	Congratz on the win! I'm a bit curious about winning my first game too.
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	I'm trying to learn racquetball myself, but I can't figure out which game you won.
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	Ya, it was my very first cage game as well! I was so excited.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	What sport?
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
