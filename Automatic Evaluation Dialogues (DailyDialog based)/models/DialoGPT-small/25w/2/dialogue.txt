Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	He has seen this friend like 3 times, it was his first time and last time.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	Well, no that was the last time we saw this friend.
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	It's been like that for the last 2 yrs
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	That sounds exciting and exciting. We just started my life over.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	She smiles back. I have an interest in riding bull. I guess you have a reason for it.
