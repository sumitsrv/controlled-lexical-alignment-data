Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	How do you know how it's doing? You do not recall meeting me? I was the first one to respond to a friend's request and you
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	It's not a good sign that you don't want me to dance with you again D:
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	That was fun to say
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	You mean you aren't in the med tech field? Or what's going on IRL?
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	Oh I know what that is.And what you have a private practice for?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	I know exactly what that is. I'm also not elitist.
