Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	It is sad that people keep thinking that cat is a human.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	The day is far far away! I am a bit sad. I have seen people post catfood and her name. :P
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	I would have to go somewhere, not anywhere. Just a bit. I'm going places.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	Why did they not zipline you up?
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	Yeah I can only imagine, you have a big head.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	Yeah, you should make one.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	Oh my goodness, yes!!! That's so good. It's like ziplining. I would totally buy a drink and pop some chips
