A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: it's _great_ , thanks . i'm trying _to_ learn _how_ _to_ _make_ croissants . 
B|3| Human 2: hows _the_ food ? 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far _, but_ they haven't been _flakey_ enough . i'm trying _to_ figure out why . what kind of cookies _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: [how] about [you] [make] [them] [flakey] _and_ [have] [them] be [flakey] ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i'll_ [have] [to] do [them] _all_ tomorrow then [, but] _i_ guess _it_ might be alright :d 
A|8| Human 1: now that is a good idea . [i'll] give [it] a try _next_ time . would [you] say [you] [have] a sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: _that's_ [great] _! the_ [next] one will be more cakey . 
A|10| Human 1: some people don't ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , _i think_ i'd eat pastries [all] [the] time if [i] could _get_ away with [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: oh ! [i] [get] pasty [too] ! you're right . 
A|12| Human 1: wow [! the] last time [i] paid attention [to] that sort of stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as a fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts of crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: makes sense [i think] :p 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
