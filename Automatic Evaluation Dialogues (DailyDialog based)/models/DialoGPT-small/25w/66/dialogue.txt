Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	15.6 mph in my 1rm, 7.7 in my 4rm. Running a 5k
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	No but we're going to start running on the 10th. My next 5k and I'm gonna get to finish it!
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	I like running marathons and fitness. How much time do you need to run?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	What's fun
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	I live in San Bernardino I'm interested.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	How long will it be going up in California? I'm currently in the same position, and I want to practice.
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	That sounds cool! I do have a time and a place for training
