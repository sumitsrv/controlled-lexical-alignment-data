Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	u TheRekTurtle is the teacher, so I'm not too sure, but you should see him if you feel like going.
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	I think you can. It seems like the same slides as you were taking this exam.
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	I'm so sorry.
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	I'm in class?
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	So far. This is the hardest exam on the first grade.
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	Thanks. I did a great job with the first class, i'll be working on my final exam week
