Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Good morning people!
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	Ya, I'll be the one that goes to that one lol
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	I'll be at the weekend as well, so I have time to watch the next 2 games, and I'm going to have a lot of fun
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	I'm a Sharks fan and watching hockey and hockey is a life saver so I watch the sharks!
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	This weekend?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	I should I.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	I have no qualms about that though I'm trying to win a fight though.
