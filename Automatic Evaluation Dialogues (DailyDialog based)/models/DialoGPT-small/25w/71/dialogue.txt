Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	I'm getting a little nervous, this is starting to look really strange...
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	I screamed in my sleep in a very loud voice...
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	I was screaming for hours, and then it just got shelved.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	If I were someone who lost someone I would be soooo excited to tell you
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	That's good. I am feeling better.
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	Ohh so I get it. How do you feel? How are your body and brain going after keto? Lol
