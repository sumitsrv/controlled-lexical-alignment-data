Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	It's Christmas in the summer here, I'm here to stay and be around everyone.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	How long are you staying at Disneyland for? I would suggest a long term stay
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	Drive up and drive down Disney Blvd?
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	I wouldnt mind.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	I think most of the parks are closed. So maybe some weekends?
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	Can you do that for me? We could work something out for a little cash.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	I think i can do that for you.It has to be lego world
