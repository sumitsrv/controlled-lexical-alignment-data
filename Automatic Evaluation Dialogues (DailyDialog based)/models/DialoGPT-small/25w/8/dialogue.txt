Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	Morning afternoon! Hope you had a good day! How have you been?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	Well, I guess we both feel the same way! I'm out for next week anyway
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	Hey! Are u back from vacation for another month?
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	Ohhh I'm gonna
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	Where are you from? I'm from Hawaii.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	I live in California, there's tons of water available.
