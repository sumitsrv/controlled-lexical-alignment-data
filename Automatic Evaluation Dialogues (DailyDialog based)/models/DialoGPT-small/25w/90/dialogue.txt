Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	Yes, we are going to compete, we have a tournament this season. We will do all sports competitions.
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	I have no idea how will you have this event going? Do we have a venue, the venue is in the middle of nowhere. Is that correct
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	this summer events?
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	I can.
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	Hey, what days are
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	Hey! If anyone's interested, I can help with the organizing
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	I have to work the next day, but maybe this evening
Human 1:	 Thanks.
