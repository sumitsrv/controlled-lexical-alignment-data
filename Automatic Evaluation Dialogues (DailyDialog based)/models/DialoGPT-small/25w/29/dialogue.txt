Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	I love how it shows everyone's faces in this picture. I love it! How are you doing?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	What class is this? I know I've seen you in the past.
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	Yeah, my wife teaches sewing classes at college.
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	Tea?
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	Hahahaha. tea. I love tea?
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	You like white ones, I get those too huh?
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	I don't like tea, the only thing I like about teas is that taste
