Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	Yayy! I'm glad you like it! How's your day going?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	Oh yeah! I'm really excited for the holiday break!
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	A few projects for fun! I'm a student though so I'm not sure what you like to do :P
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	Yep I started a few weeks ago :P
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	Oh sweet! Hahaha I have no idea how long it is though!
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	Yeah, I have a couple miles left too! And some of my favorite courses! It's like a marathon or a sprint for the runners.
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	What time are you running this year?
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	How long ago was this?
