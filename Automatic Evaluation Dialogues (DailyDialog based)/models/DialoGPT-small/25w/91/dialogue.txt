Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	Hey, I just moved here! How's it been?
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	I just had class for a few hours now but I'm home and I'm going to the dentist tomorrow. So you have plenty of time.
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	I'm at the dentist and have to work for a few hours.
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	I have been going...
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	I'ma story that. :p? :
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	So? Lol I just read the comic.
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	It's a comic.it.should work.for you but it's not funny.You are the only one here.I was joking
