Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	I'm just fine.
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	I'm doing pretty well. My email box is full of emails from people that have actually gotten my email, I just get to read everything.
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	I do work outside of work but I'm not on the internet.
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	I do. I'm doing a marathon of movies for my summer marathon.
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	Well I don't watch movies but I watch most of the terminators
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	Yeah but the end is a little long. You get a bit in
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	The end is great, it's just a little short, you won't understand but at the end
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	I have no idea, I've never watched it either haha
Human 1:	 Thanks!
