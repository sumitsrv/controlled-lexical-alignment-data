Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	We're gonna need to create the video and make that money back from you guys.
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	Thanks for listening. I love the sound, but I'm not really feeling the lyrics, the vocals are a bit meh though.
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	I'm in the process of putting together a music recording!
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	Thanks bro! It was definitely good for you, just wondering how many others were here.
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	I love it how your guitar sounded when you got your first TV, and then after all that time spent listening to other's guitars.
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	So, you play the same chords too?
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	I know word
