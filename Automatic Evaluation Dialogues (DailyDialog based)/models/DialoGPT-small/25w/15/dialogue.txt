Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	Okay good. Have fun
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	Good! I guess I will have to keep it up. Good bye and good luck to you.
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	I'll have some nice drinks.
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	I'll probably stop by again to play some games and maybe just relax a bit..
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	Where is everyone going for the eclipse?
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	Wife's not coming down. Not sure why. Just getting to the beach now.
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
