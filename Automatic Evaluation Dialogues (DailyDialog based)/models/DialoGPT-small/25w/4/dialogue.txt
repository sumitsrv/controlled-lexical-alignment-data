Human 2:	 Helloooooo!
Human 1:	 How are you? How is your day?
Human 2:	My day is going so well, I need to go outside and play with the lights.
Human 1:	 I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.
Human 2:	I'm feeling very happy. I am so ready to be alive in a year.
Human 1:	 Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?
Human 2:	What if you think that green is a bad colour?
