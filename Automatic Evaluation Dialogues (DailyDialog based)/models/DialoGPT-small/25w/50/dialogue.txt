Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	I'm not too far away! We are having fun. It is so far!
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	I am going to the game, hopefully! I will stay home and watch the game.
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	I'm going to Madrid. It's pretty much the same city but it's not so nice
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	So?
