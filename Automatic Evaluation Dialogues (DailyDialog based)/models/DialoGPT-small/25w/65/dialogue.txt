Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	Morning u korokk 3l! I'm good now. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	It's not bad...
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	I've used diesel for 2 hours and I'm still going strong. The car won't stop running. It's the engine that is the problem.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	Ehm!
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	Okay. That's fine
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	You know I've been told that, but now you can't refute it.
