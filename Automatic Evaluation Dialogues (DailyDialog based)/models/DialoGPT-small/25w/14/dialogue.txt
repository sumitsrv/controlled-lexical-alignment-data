Human 2:	Well, now how are you, sir?
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	Ya, yeah? What'd you do today?
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	You went to Disney World, didn't you, and stayed at a amusement park for a day for an hour.
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	Why does the world's tallest roller coaster keep going?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	Oh my god, I'm going to
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	Haha yea I think it's fun for the first few rides.
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	So glad I did it! Good job, glad to have it done at the right time
