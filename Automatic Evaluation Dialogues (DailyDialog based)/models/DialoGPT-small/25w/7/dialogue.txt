Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	It's not Avatar, I have no idea what that is even
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	This is the Avatar movie? I've seen it in theaters. What's it like?
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	Are you talking about movies?
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	Why do you enjoy eating when you can consume it in an instant movie
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	It's alright. I can bake some food but I don't like to eat it.
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	I'm out tonight but I have all the soup and some veggies.
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	I'm out of the house so I can cook!
