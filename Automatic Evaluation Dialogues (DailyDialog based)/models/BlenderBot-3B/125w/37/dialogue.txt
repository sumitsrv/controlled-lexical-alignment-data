Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking. I love soccer, it's like my favorite. Whats your favorite team?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm great but I think you would have fun with friends since you play
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I would rather play with people but i'm not that good either. It can be fun though.
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I would recommend it. Switch's are so much fun!  The games are great for families and kids alike. It has an online mode
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I love reading too, it's the best way for me to get away from my wife lol. It's fun just to be able to go somewhere
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 That's pretty cool, I love reading. I read for fun too but the most recent thing i finished was the Navy SEALs book
