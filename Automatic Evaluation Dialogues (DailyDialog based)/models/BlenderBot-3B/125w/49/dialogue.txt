Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Howdy, good day. I am good, and your's?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 I work the weekends, so its not like I can just stay home and play a video game, lol. How about you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 I live to watch the weekends, I am going to party it up!
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 I love going out to watch the Hokey live - its so much fun. We actually are going to go to the local amphithe
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 That sounds like fun! I can't this weekend but I wish I could. Have you ever been to the Cowboys stadium in Arling
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 That's very cool, I'm actually thinking about signing up myself but I am not sure I will have the time and effort to commit to training
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 That's so cool I wish I had that confidence!
