Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 My day was good. How was yours?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It had been a good long time. Like over a year, but since I was with friends I didn't mind because it was a great time and
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm great.   How was your day?  Deep sea fishing looks neat!
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I haven't been deep sea fishing before.  Have you tried out any other recreational activities like that?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I have not before! I've been to the ocean before but it's a very different experience and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I really like going there because the city itself is very impressive. Its just a shame I don't get to do anything fun with all of the sea
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I've never been there, but it is such a big city. What makes you think you'd like Tokyo over the other places?
