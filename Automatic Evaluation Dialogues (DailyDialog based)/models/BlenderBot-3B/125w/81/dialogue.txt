Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	 I've been great just relaxing
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 I am great, thanks. What happened that you got ice everywhere?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	 haha you must have been so mad that you didn't remember but i'm glad you are alright and learned from your mistake
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 No, that was it. I just got really tired after the ice and slipped and fell on my ass.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I've never been there but have always wanted to go - it's the Olympic Stadium of Canada and hosts the 2016 Games
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 Yeah! I am not used to the ice. I just wanted to be cool. but that kind of ruined it. It felt so slippery
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 Ouch! Are you able to still skate? You should! I just got back from the Beijing games and that was a ton of
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
