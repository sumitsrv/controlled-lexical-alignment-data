Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well! I just finished watching the movie Safety Not Guaranteed with my wife, you?
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm well! I was doing a little cleaning as well! I love that movie
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I really enjoy doing yard work and cleaning and gardening.  I enjoy it a ton.  
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I'm usually more into fantasy movies but it has been a long time since I've seen one. How about you?
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I like action movies but not so much fantasy, it's one or the other. I never watched terminators. I've heard about that movie
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 haha you probably will get the itch again soon then but that is cool, there's a lot of action movies about time travellers that
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 I have never seen it either.  I like fantasy movies though.
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 I guess you like time travel and action movies that's cool. But I didn't watch it because I don't want to get spoiled.
Human 1:	 Thanks!
