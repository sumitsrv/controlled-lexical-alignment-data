Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Bruhhh?
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 It was going well until a customer came in with a screaming kid. He got all my co-workers, so I'm having an anxiety attack
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm very sorry to hear that. I've been where you are and I wish someone was there for me to help me.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry that you've been dealing with that!   I lost my mom and one of my children.  It was hard but it
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I am so sorry for your hardship and how angry you must be.  
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I am good. Just trying to enjoy some time to myself after working out!
