Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 How was the trip last weekend?
Human 2:	 Nothing was up, I was in the hospital last weekend
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	 A couple places, I did all the work for the last three months and was the sole worker with no help, but that was because she left.
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	 It was good. I did the cooking and the catering for the wedding. I got a little over worked, but it was fun.
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	 it sounds amazing! you did all the cooking huh?
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	 Well, the cooking was actually off of our menu from a restaurant. I did the dishes but it was my husband who cooked it.
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	 That's lovely, the team will love you for that! How long did it take you guys to cook the meal?
