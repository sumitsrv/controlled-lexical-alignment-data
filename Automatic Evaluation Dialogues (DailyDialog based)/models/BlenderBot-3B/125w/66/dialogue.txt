Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I have been training for a marathon for 2 weeks now, so I hope so!
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 Yes! I am planning to the marathon in London in June 2019.
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 I am not but maybe I will do another race in the future but I want some time off.
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 I like marathons, not the biggest fan of running obstacles but they're not a big deal. I hope you enjoy your race
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 That sounds like quite the adventure! You must be in pretty good shape to do one of those race events.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 You have to be in good shape if you want to be competitive and finish first. I was thinking about signing up for one next month
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 I would like to try for the next one, I just have a lot of time. I live in San Jose so its not too far of
