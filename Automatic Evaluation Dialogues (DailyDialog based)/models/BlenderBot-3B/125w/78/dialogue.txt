Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 I've always wanted to since being a kid haha, I love baked goods so much
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 I guessed that right on the first try. I'm actually not a psychic, I was just guessing!
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I'm a psychic and I feel like you're the next chef
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 Maybe you're right!  And I didn't say no baking was involved, haha.    The cake was amazing.
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 What are you guessing for?  I love the best that my favorite thing ever to bake was my first chef job in a cake decor
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 That's cool. What are you guessing for? I am a student
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I like to bake but have never done the cake decorating before, but this time around my mom said she was going to make a big
