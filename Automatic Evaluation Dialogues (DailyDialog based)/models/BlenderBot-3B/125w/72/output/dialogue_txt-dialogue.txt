A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ reflect back too much on things _, but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ _me_ in terms _of_ _time_ spent _with_ _family and friends_ _and_ _work_ _life_ balance . why _do_ [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [have been very] _busy_ [with] [work] . i'm _a_ teacher [and] _my_ classroom _is_ always _a_ crazy [time] [of] _year_ ! 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! _good_ _idea_ _to_ _help_ _people_ figuring out their _new year_ resolutions 🙂 so _how_ _do_ [i] _get a fresher outlook_ ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [don't] _think_ [you] [get a fresher outlook] [, but] [you] [have] [to] accept _the_ [new year] [and] _be_ happy [with] [life] ! 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ ! _i think the idea_ does [have] some potential . _how did you_ come up [with] [this] _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [good] [for] [you] , [how did you] [do] [that] ? 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] [is] valuable _help_ [for] [the] _community_ . _i think_ _mental health_ [is] _one_ [of] [the] bigger _challenges_ facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: well [i] [have] [a] [family and] [i think the idea] _of a_ [community] _that is_ all _about_ [one] person [is] [great] [for] them [and] [me] 
A|10| Human 1: [that is] actually [a] quote stolen from [my] tl when [i] joined [my] first _company_ after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs [of] [work] experience , [i] fully _agree_ [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: _that's_ _true_ - [people] [with] [mental health] [challenges] can't [help] [but] feel [the] need [for] [company] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . _stay_ happy; [i think] _family and friends_ play [a] big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] _keep_ [you] [busy] ... so on 🙂 [what] [about] [you] ? [is] there [a] right answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [that] [work] really helps [with] [mental health] [and] [is] [the] _best_ support . it's _not_ [the] [family and friends] [that] [you] [have] [with] your [family] [that] [you] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! [that's] [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also music earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [great] [you] found such [a] [great] place [with] [a] [great] boss [and] [family] . 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually [not] much [of a] reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: yes [i] [agree] , [family and friends] [help] us [stay] positive [and] [keep] us going . 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! [true] ! it may turn out [to] [be] [a] [best] seller :)
