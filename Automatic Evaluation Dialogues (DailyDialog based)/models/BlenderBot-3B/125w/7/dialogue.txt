Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I am not much of a movie fan but I saw the force awakens the other day, what's your favorite?
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 I have seen it, but not recently. Do you mean the movie with James Cameron, or Avatar, the animated Poc
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I like science-fiction movies that are set in the far out in the future. I recently saw the first Star Wars movie with Mark Hamill
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 I saw the movie with Avatar, what about you? how did you like it?
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 I like it too! My favorite food is chicken and waffles! What is you favorite food?
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 That soup sounds so delicious and like a lot of food!  I've never had it personally but it must have been created by Chinese immigrants
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 Yes, I think so too. Do you like to bake as well?
