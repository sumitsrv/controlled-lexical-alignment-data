Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I'm doing great, just got my paycheck today and have the day off so i'm eating out with some friends. And you?

Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?

Human 2:	 I think that would be the one to say, it's really versatile and you can eat it with other things like rice and beans
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I mean you could probably eat a ton of muddy food like me, and be fine but the lack of nutrition would surely bother you
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
