Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 How is your day going?
Human 2:	 I am great, thanks so much! How about you?
Human 1:	 How is your day?
Human 2:	 I'm just going to the store for snacks.   How about you?
Human 1:	 I went to gym and worked on weight lifting.
Human 2:	 I don't exercise ever so I am not looking good at the moment lol. What do you do?
Human 1:	 No, I am just a starter.
Human 2:	 I just went and lifted weights.
Human 1:	 I go everyday. In fact, I'm in a running challenge.
Human 2:	 I just started running, and it's going ok.  I'm just starting out, though.
Human 1:	 It's actually not that impressive. I can only run. I cannot lift weight.
Human 2:	 I'm not looking very good either. I can only run for a short distance. It's actually just a little more than I jog.
Human 1:	 Oh that's a really interesting idea. I like to be coa
