Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Good day! I have been working on some stuff in the garden. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 It's going well so far, just chilling and getting ready to work on the garden. I've had so much fun this morning
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 Hi, that's a shame to hear that your motorcycle broke down. 
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Yeah that is good you get it fixed so soon.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Yes I think I will be able to pick you up today
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 I think they should be able to win but their last game today was a loss. Do you have a good record this season?
