A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once or twice so far , _but_ [they] haven't _been_ flakey enough . i'm trying [to] figure out why . what _kind _of_ cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] peanut [cookies] , [they] [have] [been] _a_ hit _with_ everyone [i've] shared [them] _with_ . what's your favorite [kind of] cro 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , thanks !

B|11| Human 2: [i] love [the] [sweet] ones [with] chocolate _and_ nuts [too] ! they're my favorite . [but] [i think] [you] should [try] [the] [cookies] [that] [i] mentioned , [it] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all sorts_ [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [i] [have a sweet tooth] for [all sorts] [and] types [of] food !
