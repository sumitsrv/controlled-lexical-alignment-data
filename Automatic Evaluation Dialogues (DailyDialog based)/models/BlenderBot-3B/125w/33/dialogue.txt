Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 It is a great thing to learn. I love how they are softer in the middle compared to other pastries.
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I've made peanut cookies, they have been a hit with everyone I've shared them with. What's your favorite kind of cro
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I've been working on a chocolate chip cookie recipe that my daughter is making for a treat.
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I have made a variety of cookies that are sweet but also topped with nuts and chocolate
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I love the sweet ones with chocolate and nuts too! They're my favorite. But I think you should try the cookies that I mentioned, it
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I think I have a sweet tooth for all sorts and types of food!
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
