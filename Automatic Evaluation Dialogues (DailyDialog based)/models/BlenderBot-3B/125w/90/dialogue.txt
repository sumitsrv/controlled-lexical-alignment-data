Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I would like to volunteer for it but my work will probably interfere. Is there anything you would suggest I do?
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 There is nothing funer about volunteer work, and you have the added benefit of helping others out. I like to donate money to char
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 Great you have fun and i will send all details for your participation
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 We are looking for the volunteers and will have a pot luck event with an open bar! Would you like to go?
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 That would be wonderful! I will get the ball rolling by next week and see how it goes. 
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 Yes! Thank you! Can you tell me the date and time of the event?
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 It is a sunday so we can have the whole day. It will be great to help with a event like this.
Human 1:	 Thanks.
