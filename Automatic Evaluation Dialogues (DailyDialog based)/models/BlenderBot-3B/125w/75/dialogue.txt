Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 Hey, that's the first time I've met you. You have a nice face, I don't recall meeting you before. It was nice.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 Did you go to the meet up on saturday?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 No that was not I
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm an engineer with a private practice. 
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you are talking about, but that sounds like a hard job.
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I'm a physical therapist and also have a medical degree, but you know it's just not the same as what doctors do, you know?
