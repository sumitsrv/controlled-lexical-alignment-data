Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	 Hi there! I'm good! Do you have any holiday traditions for Thanksgiving?
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	 I have lots of plans for Thanksgiving coming up.  Lots of food, football, and the beverages are my family's traditions
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 Nice you have a good time for Thanksgiving with family and friends, it's a holiday we celebrate in Canada on November 1
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 Nice! I'm going for the food, my family has one every year to celebrate some day that people go to to eat really good food.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 I believe that was the same one. I hope you have all a good time and enjoy the food and beverages
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It's the one hosted at Disney in Florida every year. There was so much food and it was really nice getting to see people I know.
