Human 2:	 I'm good! How about you? What are your plans? New York is a great place to visit.
Human 1:	 Ahh what city? I've visited India before.
Human 2:	 I love NY and visited once, I've never been to India before. I hope to go again.
Human 1:	 Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?
Human 2:	 I've never been to India - it's on the list of places I want to go. They have so many food that I need to try.
Human 1:	 Yes. I was actually just there a few weeks ago for Thanksgiving and got to see the first snow of the season! Ever been to New York?
Human 2:	 I was just visiting for the New Year, actually. I will probably take my wife and kids there for Christmas this year.
