Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	 It is going pretty well. I'm going to try and record some video tomorrow morning. I was just hoping the wind would not be so bad tonight
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	 I've got a video for you tomorrow evening when the light is out in the garden, its going to be a good one. 
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	 I use a variety. Usually music from video games and movies though. Some are for the fun of it though.
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	 I am more interested in the music you are listening to now. Nice try though
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 I play guitar too.  What kind did you buy?
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 I got an acoustic guitar for the first time. I still can't play very well though.  
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 It's like learning any other instrument though, the first months are the worst. Once you get them down pat they can come pretty easy!
