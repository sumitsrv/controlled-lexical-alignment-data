Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 Hi! I like Christmas and Holi but my favorite thing is seeing everyone get ready and decorate the house.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 That's a huge number. Are you a homemaker?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 I think I was a better one when I was a child.
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 Yes it's fun but can get quite chaotic at times and I think everyone has different opinions on what is really important.
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 Not really, but it's my life and what I love to do in my spare time, but you are right.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 what you mean spooky?
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 Yes. I have a whole room of books of treasure hunting maps, spooky ghost stories and ghost busters props.
