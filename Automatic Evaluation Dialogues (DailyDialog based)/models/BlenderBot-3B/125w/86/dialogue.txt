Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	 I do not have anything planned. I am going to the beach
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well just got back from the beach. Christmas is always a fun family holiday where most families get together with family for the day
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	 I'm going to the beach too!  I just love the water.  Where did you go?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	 I have been to several of the Uganda beaches. The ones with lots of jungle and wildlife.  
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	 I have been to the beach and to a national park. It was so fun. I just wish there were more animals around though. How did
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	 Yes it was very different, I loved it there.  There were so many people and the culture was so welcoming.
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	 I'm not really familiar with the Uganda beach but is it a volunteer organization or a charity?
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
