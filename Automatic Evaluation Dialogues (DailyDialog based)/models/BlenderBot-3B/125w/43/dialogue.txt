Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 No, I am not this time. How are you?
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 I've had a pretty rough couple of weeks overall, but you are right, the mentorship programme for this cycle has been great
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 I am participating in the Early Care for Students program at the local highschool this time. The mentor has been amazing!
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 I find it good to have someone to talk to sometimes
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 I have had good mentors as well but sometimes you need that extra time to get things sorted out
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 I have two mentors this time, they are both good, but yeah there is something to be said for getting an additional perspective.
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
