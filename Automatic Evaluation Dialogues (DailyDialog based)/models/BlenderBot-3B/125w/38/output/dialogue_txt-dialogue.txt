A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about _human _like_ chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hey ! not much , [you] ? whats your favorite bot ? _i_ [like chat bots] , especially _the_ ones _that_ _can_ answer questions _and_ play games . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to have_ _made_ some _great_ progress over last few years . do [you] _think_ [the] positives outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: oh yes [the] [bots] [have] been [great] _. they_ really get people [to] socialize online . _i think it_ _has_ [made] people _more_ outgoing too . 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though [it] _sounds_ far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ [like chat bots] _that_ [have] user interfaces _that_ allow [you] [to] [chat] _with_ them _and_ other [human] users . 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! some _of_ these [bots] _are very_ engaging [and] funny _. they are_ _now_ _good_ _at_ even sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [like] [the] [chat bots] [that] allow [you] [to] [chat] _with_ an actor _as_ opposed [to] _a_ real person [. they [are] very] [good] [and] fun [to] [chat] _with_ 
A|10| Human 1: [i think it] [can] take many different forms [as] [a] product . [the] research implication is _also_ huge ! _it will_ signify how ai research [has] progressed _so_ far [and] _better_ place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort _of_ [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might _be_ overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [bots] [can] [and] [are] [also] learning [from] us [now] ! [the] [human] interaction makes them [more] [human like] , [i think] [that] [will] [be] [great] [to have] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already do _pretty_ [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [i] can't wait for [the] [more] advanced [bots] [like] [that] [to] become [better] [at] understanding [human] behaviors [and] interactions . [it will] make things [so] much 
A|14| Human 1: haha , _pretty_ far fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that] [sounds] [pretty] impressive [and] [the] advancements [that] [will] happen in [the] near future [with] [this] kind [of] technology .
