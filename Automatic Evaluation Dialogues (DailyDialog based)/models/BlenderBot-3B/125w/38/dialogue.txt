Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	 Hey! Not much, you? Whats your favorite bot? I like chat bots, especially the ones that can answer questions and play games.
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	 Oh yes the bots have been great. They really get people to socialize online. I think it has made people more outgoing too.
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	 I like chat bots that have user interfaces that allow you to chat with them and other human users. 
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 I like the chat bots that allow you to chat with an actor as opposed to a real person. They are very good and fun to chat with
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	 The bots can and are also learning from us now! the human interaction makes them more human like, I think that will be great to have
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	 I can't wait for the more advanced bots like that to become better at understanding human behaviors and interactions. It will make things so much
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 That sounds pretty impressive and the advancements that will happen in the near future with this kind of technology.
