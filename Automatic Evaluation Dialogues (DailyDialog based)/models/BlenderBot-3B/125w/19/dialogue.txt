Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 Hello the superman! Whats a good way to spend the day? Im going to the zoo!
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 You know, I just finished a big project at work and you just won't believe it, but I feel invisible! I don't feel
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 that's good you can trust the machine learning to see the truth and not to mess you up.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 fMRI's can be rather scary and you can't tell what images they are showing you. that is for sure.
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 I've been told that I can't die from it because my brain does not have enough room to do so, but it's very scary.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 Science is the process of looking for answers and discovering new things. I'm just glad my brain can see what the images tell me
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 Yes exactly. Science is the most important thing about life. I love science. The fact that it can solve medical and biological problems with technology
