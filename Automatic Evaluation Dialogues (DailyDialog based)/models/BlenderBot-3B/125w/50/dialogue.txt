Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 Good and busy here. I was supposed to finish up my work early, but I have a lot to do. But now, I don't know
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 I was going to the gym but that's been cancelled for a rainy day
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 I was just going to the game but it's pouring and the field is so hard now that I feel like I would be better off at
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 Europe is always great for the weekend trips that's why I plan to go back
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 It's really not too bad you should try and practice with someone if you are going to visit. You will get the gist pretty fast.
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
