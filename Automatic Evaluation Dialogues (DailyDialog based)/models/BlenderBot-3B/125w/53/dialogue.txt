Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Great so far! Just got off work a few minutes ago
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I have a busy day too. I work for the weekend so I'm trying to get home and catch up on the house chores that need to
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 I like to get out there and be with friends, especially family
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I just run a bit every morning before work on my lunch break.
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I like that you work on the weekends.  Do you have a long commute?
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I have no idea how long a marathon is! I guess I'll just run when I wake up.
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I don't know the distances well, but it has to be at least 6 miles to qualify as a marathon. Do you have
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 That makes sense. I have one in march and its about 8 miles. Are you training well this year?
