Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I'm okay.  Just doing my best to make sure I get everything done today so I can have lots of free time next week.
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that, do homework can be a real pain sometimes
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm a bit sleepy myself. Biology was never my thing. Are you doing a lot to study?
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 i am a senior high school student in my sophomore year.
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I'm actually in medical school at the moment. 
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 No, I'm not doing enough homework. I'm gonna fail that exam
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 I'm a sophomore student also. I don't think you can practice that much, no.
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I think that's what's so frustrating. I try so hard and always get it. 
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 I just want to graduate early that is why its stressing me out a little bit.
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
