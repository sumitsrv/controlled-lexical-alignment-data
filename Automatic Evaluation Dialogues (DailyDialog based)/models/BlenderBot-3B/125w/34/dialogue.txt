Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 I am talking about all the family parties and shopping. My daughter is getting married, so we are going to have one of her family's thanksg
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 My plans for this thanksgiving have not been made yet, as we have a lot of pets to take care of. Are you cooking for
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 My family just plans to spend the day with each other, and we may make pie or pumpkin bread. I love Christmas, it's one
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 I would love to but my husband does not like the Thanksgiving food I make for all our kids. I think it is good
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 My wife and I have the same problem with our family, so we normally just buy them some gifts.
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	 that is the best time of the year for me.. what do you like to make?
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
