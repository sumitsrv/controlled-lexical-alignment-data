Human 2:	 Hahaha it was great! But I would have been so sad if I wasn't invited.
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 I cooked it for my wife and 3 children.  My mother was jealous I got to host thanksgiving for a little while before she got
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 It always the turkey you are not so big on, but its always a good time with a lot of family.
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 It was at our local fair with lots of friends and family, so you are always welcome to join us and we'll have turkey and rolls
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 I did, that is always fun. We all made pies and the washed all the dishes together.
