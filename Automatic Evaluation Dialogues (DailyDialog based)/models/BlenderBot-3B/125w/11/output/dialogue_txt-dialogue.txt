A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ roses _are_ _pretty_ , even though _some_ _people_ can't figure _it_ out . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why does _the_ lotus spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ don't know , [the] [flower] _that_ represents [a] woman _as_ love _, and_ [the] power _of_ _life_ _and_ love _is_ _just_ _so_ _pretty_ [to] me 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! [just] [a] personal theory _. i think_ [that] [flower] preferences [are] _more_ revealing [of] personality than [people] appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure , _maybe_ because [flower] gardens [are] _so_ popular these days _and_ [the] roses [have] been around [that] long [. i think] [i] 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera _. it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then [it] came [to] [life] . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's] interesting [you] mention [that] [i think] [a] lot [of] [people] [like] roses because [it's] been such [a] popular [flower] _with the_ world since they [are] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask _someone_ what _their_ favourite [flower] [is] . [pretty] much [like] what we [just] did . does [that] make sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [just] [think] flowers [are] beautiful in [their] own right [. it's] [the] [flower] [that] [someone] was most attuned [with] [and] [you] [like] [it] [more] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with the] person [some] [more] [, and] ask _them_ [some] [more] questions [, and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] [maybe] two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [like] [them] too they [are] [pretty] [and] [the] petals can vary in colors . 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
