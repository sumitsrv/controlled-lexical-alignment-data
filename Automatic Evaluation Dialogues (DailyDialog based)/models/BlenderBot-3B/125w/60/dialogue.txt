Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 Good. It's going. I'm going on a trip to the beach for the weekend with my family and friends.
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 How fun! I went climbing the other day with my dad and his friends. It was pretty great, we cancelled all our plans to
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 That sounds great, I'm glad you guys got to share the experience! I went to the movie The Hobbit last weekend, it was fantastic
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 That sounds like a great time! This one was the movie that came out in theaters back in July, I am so excited to see
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 that's awesome the hobbit was good. it came out in october of last year.
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 Yes! I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I'm with you on that. But once you've been in the southern hemisphere during winter it's hard to imagine going back
