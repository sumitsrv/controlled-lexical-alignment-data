Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I love to skydive, have you done it before?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I have not but my wife and I have gone skydiving, but not in Spain because it is very expensive
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 I'm not, but I do like to pretend to be for fun. Have you done it before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I actually just did the jump last month at skydiving mountain, a small town in northern california. It was amazing!
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I tried skydiving once. A tandem parachuting jump, that was pretty cool.
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 Not that much. The closest I've come was skiing down the slope of a mountain and landed on the snow for a second time
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
