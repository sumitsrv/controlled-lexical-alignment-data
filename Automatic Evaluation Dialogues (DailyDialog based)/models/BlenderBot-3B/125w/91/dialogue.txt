Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	 General Kenobi! Its been a long day, I am so tired! How about you?
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	 I'm tired now that I work a double shift! But it's not until 5
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	 I have the day off and the most interesting thing that happened today was that we found a dead cat in the woods and a pig.
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	 I've been up for days and have slept the rest of the day. How did you end up finding that?
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 I don't know how the literature has been, but that sounds like a game of russian roulette.
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	 I'm the same way! I don't trust that snake oil stuff either!
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	 I don't even know how it got here but it's definitely not the best kind of literature you want to be reading on your own.
