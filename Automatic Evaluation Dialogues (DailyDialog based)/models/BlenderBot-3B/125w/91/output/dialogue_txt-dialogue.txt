A|6| Human 1: what ? why would [you] do _that ?_ take _the_ least _interesting_ [day] _of the_ week _off and_ [work] _on_ _the most interesting_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ [have] [the] [day] [off and] [the most interesting] thing [that] happened [today] _was_ [that] we found [a] dead cat in [the] woods [and] [a] pig .
