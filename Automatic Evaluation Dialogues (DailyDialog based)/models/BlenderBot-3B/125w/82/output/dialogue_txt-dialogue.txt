B|5| Human 2: [just enjoying] [the] fall weather and _getting_ [to] know new people . [i] [just] turned 22 , [i] need [to] meet some new people 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ _is_ actually from peru , which _is_ more my taste . _smoking_ _isn't_ very _healthy_ _, but_ _it's_ actually _quite_ relaxing , which in _a_ _way_ _is_ _good_ _for_ _your_ health . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: [a] [good] smoke [is] [one] _that_ gets _you_ [the] [way] _it_ used [to] 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ "you _only live_ once" as _they say_ !

A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] see . [that] [is] [a] much harder task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [think] [they say] [it's] [a] real [way] [to] go [, but] [it] may [not] [be] . [i] [would be] fine with [that] if [i] could [live] forever .
