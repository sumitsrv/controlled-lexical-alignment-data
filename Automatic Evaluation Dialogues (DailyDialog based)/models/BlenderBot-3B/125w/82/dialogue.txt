Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking to find some people to listen to some metal with.
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Just enjoying the fall weather and getting to know new people. I just turned 22, I need to meet some new people
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 A good smoke is one that gets you the way it used to
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 That's quite a healthy hobby but isn't it bad to live once?
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 Oh haha yes you only live once, but that doesn't mean you have to live your life like a moron either. I am not into smoking
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 you will not live after death but just for that time it was nice to think of it that way, yes
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 I think they say it's a real way to go, but it may not be. I would be fine with that if I could live forever.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
