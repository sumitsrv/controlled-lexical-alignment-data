Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Yes! I have no idea how I'm gonna get home today, it's pretty bad
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Yes the rain is pretty bad but I don't like that wind so much
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 I know what you mean! It's like the rain just came out of nowhere and was so heavy. Where do you live?
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 I don't like the rain either that can make for lots of mud
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 In the mountains of South Dakota, that is where all the water goes when there is no rain or snow
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 I live in the desert, but it did rain here this morning, it was so beautiful
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
