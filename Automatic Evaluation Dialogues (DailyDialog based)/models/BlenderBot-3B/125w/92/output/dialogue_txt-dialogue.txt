A|4| Human 1: haha , _beach season is coming_ ! _you_ _need _to_ look tan_ ! what _did_ _you_ _do_ indoors _all day_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _it_ [is] [good] . _i_ [did] my best [to look tan] , _i_ [went _to the] beach_ _, but_ _i_ am allergic [to] [sun] screen . 
A|6| Human 1: hahahaha , that's [pretty] funny . ever thought of bringing [your] _work_ things [to the beach] ?? 
B|7| Human 2: well _i_ [work] _at_ an office . [it's] [pretty] [good] _that_ [beach season is coming] , because _i_ [need] a [tan] too . 
A|8| Human 1: hmm [i] see . [it] sounds like _you_ [work] near [the] water _already_ _, no_ ? are _you_ some kind of fish researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: i've [already] been in [the] tanning bed [, no] [need to] [do] [it] again , lol .

B|13| Human 2: [no] [not] allergies [, but] i've [never] been [to the beach] ! 
A|14| Human 1: _i'm_ [pretty] amateur ! [i] like [to] climb [at] indoor _climbing_ gyms _and_ _have never_ gone _outside_ [on] dangerous routes actually . ever _tried_ [it] yourself ?
