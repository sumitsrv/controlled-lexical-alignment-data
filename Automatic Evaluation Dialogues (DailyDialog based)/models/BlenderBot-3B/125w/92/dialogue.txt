Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 It's been pretty good, just hanging out with the family now.  
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 It is good. I did my best to look tan, I went to the beach, but I am allergic to sun screen.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 Well I work at an office. It's pretty good that beach season is coming, because I need a tan too.
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 I've already been in the tanning bed, no need to do it again, lol.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 no i work at the office on the computer all day  do you have any allergies?
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 No not allergies, but I've never been to the beach! 
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm not allergic to anything but the sun and I am pretty pale, but I have never tried climbing outside to test that theory
