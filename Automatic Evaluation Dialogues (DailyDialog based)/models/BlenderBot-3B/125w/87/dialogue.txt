Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm great, thanks!
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the latest book in the fantasy series "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe". So good.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm doing good! I'm reading the book too. The author seems like a great author and I've been enjoying it very much. She does
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I like the book, but have you read the previous one, "The Magic of Thinking big?"
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I have never read that book, but it's great to hear you like it.  What's the premise?
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 Yes, I read that in 2011 and it's one of the books I've read multiple times. I think it really makes you think things through
Human 1:	 yup!
