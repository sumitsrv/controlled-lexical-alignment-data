Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I have! It is by Miramax and it came out in 2012 I think? I heard it was a good movie
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 I haven't seen that movie before, but you must know it is a horror and has Tom Cruise in it because it is based on The Last
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 It's been a while! But the Mandalorian is one of my favorite Sci Fi shows. How did you see it?
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 That's awesome. I saw it last weekend. It's the Mandalorian film that came out in 2011 and was also produced
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I've seen a little Spiderman the last one with Andrew Garfield and Mary Jane Watson. The old movies are
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 haha I think that's the only Marvel movie I don't watch! What was so scary about it?
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I've never seen that one! I only watch Marvel movies when my little nephews force me too, haha
