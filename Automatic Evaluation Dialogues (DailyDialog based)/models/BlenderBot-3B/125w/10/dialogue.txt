Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I'm good thanks! I went to the store for milk, and got 2 packs of cookies and a milk jug. How are you?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	 Well that's unexpected, but great.  How was it?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	 No the Civil War that's cool, it was my history test
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 Yes! I know it's only next semester, but I feel so nervous about it, I can't wait!  How are you feeling about
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	 What the hell? Apparently I'm taking history again next semester? That's not right. 
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 I wasn't born one, I was turned into one. I am actually scared that my parents are going to see me in the news, I am
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	 That is cool, you were born into it? What is your job title? Are you a veterinarian? I just got to college so
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	 I'm studying to be one! The profession is very interesting - it is the job of horse personnel to care for horses on
