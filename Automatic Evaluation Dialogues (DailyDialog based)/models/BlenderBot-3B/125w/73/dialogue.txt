Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Good thanks, your's?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 It was good I just watched a basketball game.
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I'm good and no, not really a basketball fan.  I play though.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I'm the same with the names lol. The team name is the New York Grizzlies though so I am going to watch them play some
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 I'm not a fan either. The naming convention was just something my grandfather came up with when I was a kid
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 The NeurIPS is the name that the Grizzlies play under. I'm not a big fan either. How about you? 
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 New York Grizzlies was their nick name for a while. I'm not that old haha. I think it means something bad in M
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure about the movie. What was it called again?
