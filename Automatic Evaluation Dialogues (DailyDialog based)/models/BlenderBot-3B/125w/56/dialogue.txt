Human 2:	 Hi! I'm eating pizza for dinner tonight. How are you?
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	 Good I hope you are enjoying it! I'm craving some gummy worms
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	 I love pizza, you should check out this restaurant, there are so many Japanese places here.
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	 Do you prefer the Japanese restaurants for ramen or the other style? The one I had has fried onions and pickled cabbage
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	 Do you know any place near San Mateo that has the best gummy worms? I don't really like anything else about it,
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	 I like the Japanese ones, but I don't know any places near San Mateo. I have been there once though when I went to San
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
