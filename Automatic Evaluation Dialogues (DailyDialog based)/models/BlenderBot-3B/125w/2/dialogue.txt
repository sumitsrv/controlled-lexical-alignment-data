Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 I am alright how about you
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 I was just hanging out with this girl last night.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 it was over a week ago, and we had been in touch for a couple of months before that
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh yea, it has changed so much since last time, it was like a new life and we did not know each other so long ago, but
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 It's always nice for it to be routine but you should also always try to make the time for fun with friends too
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 I have a lot that is exciting right now, but I try to balance it between work and family life. I like being with my family.
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 I have no interest in that. My life has changed so much since then that it's hard to get involved in new things like that.
