Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 I know, my dad is going through some rough times at the moment
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 I believe in miracles. Maybe not a god, but there's gotta be a part of the universe out there helping people. You know?
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 I believe that the good and the people who have gone through something are the reason miracles happen.
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 I totally get you. What's the most amazing thing that's happened to you to have made you change your mind about believing in miracles
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 It makes sense to me that people have gone through things for the good of others
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 I grew up in the middle east. I guess growing up with people who did not believe in anything makes you want that and makes you want to believe
