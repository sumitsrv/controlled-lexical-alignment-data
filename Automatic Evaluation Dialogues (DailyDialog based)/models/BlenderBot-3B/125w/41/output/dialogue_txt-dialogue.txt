B|3| Human 2: [i know] , _my_ dad _is_ going _through_ some rough times at _the_ moment 
A|4| Human 1: it's too many _of_ them _out there_ _. you_ help _who_ [you] can . regardless , [i] wouldn't say _i believe in miracles_ - well , if [i] got promoted next cycle [i] might _change_ [my] _mind_ . 
B|5| Human 2: [i believe in miracles] . maybe _not_ _a_ god , but there's gotta be _a_ part [of] _the_ universe [out there] helping [people] [. you] [know] ? 
A|6| Human 1: right now , [not] much . it's unclear . career [is] [a] _good_ fallback because [you] _get_ told what _good_ means _and_ [you] act accordingly _. i_ haven't _gone through_ [the] process [of] shaping [my] values . what _about_ [you] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i believe] that [the] [good] [and] [the] _people who_ _have_ [gone through] something are [the] reason [miracles] happen . 
A|8| Human 1: we didn't [have] electricity _growing up_ . explains [a] lot . lol .

B|11| Human 2: [it makes] sense [to] [me] that [people] [have] [gone through] [things] for [the] [good] [of] others 
A|12| Human 1: all their money ? by [a] person or an organisation ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [grew up] [in] [the] middle east [. i] guess [growing up] [with people who] [did] [not] [believe in] anything [makes] [you] want that [and] [makes] [you] want [to] [believe]
