Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 I went to the park too, but my brother's dog kept barking and I missed a lot of sun.
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 It's been good. Just playing in the park. Did you enjoy the sun?
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 It's all good. I went out to the beach with my wife and two kids.
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 I work near the water like you did. Are you that tan already hahahaha
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 hahahaha yeah i have thought about it, honestly the work was very interesting all i did was fish all day you never heard of that kind of work
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 yes but not that dangerous the most dangerous thing was when some kind of pesky snakes were nearby and their alligators but very rare
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I have never tried climbing mountains but the routes and their difficulty have actually gone down a fair amount, especially in the last couple of decades
