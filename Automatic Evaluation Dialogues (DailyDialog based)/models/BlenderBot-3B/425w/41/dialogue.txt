Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 No, i know people too that are the opposite of happy.  I know they are not a miracle but are just a product of many years
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 well who can say miracles don't exist, you never know what the next day might hold. It may be some kind of out there un
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 It's true you never know what can change about people in life and the good and not so good outcomes
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 It's not good to have the mindset that what you believe in and know is miracles, you can't ever prove it. But now
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 i didn't grow up with electricity either. people can get things done and have good values if you just put the time and effort into them.
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 Not sure, but I have a lot of family who is from Puerto Rico and the people there are not as fortunate
