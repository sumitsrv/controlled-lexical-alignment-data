Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm good thanks for asking!  What game you meeting friends for?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm meeting friends with some of my friends for a soccer game but I think I would like it by myself. It's hard when you have
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I think it depends which you would prefer. It's so much fun with group exercise but if you are getting in shape I'm sure you'll enjoy
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I think getting it would be fun but I'd like to get into something I'm not terrible so I'm thinking with some friends.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I would recommend it for just about anything. It's the greatest game console of all time, so much fun
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 It's the one book I think I've read the most of. O'Brien did good with it. I'm actually thinking about reading
