Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 Not any time soon. My training is almost done. I did well today, but I did nothing over the week before it. I am so out
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 Well you see the marathon is coming so I'm going to be practicing!
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 not any time soon but i have the marathon coming up which is my favorite race and the one i like the best, you know?
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 Its fun not doing the sporting events but you can make some montly and do like the obstacle course race which are challenging
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 That sounds like fun. It's one of the longest distance events you can do
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 It does sound like a good time. 1-2 hours is about the amount of time you can race before you would not be able to carryout
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 I can sign up for next time with the training I have already done!
