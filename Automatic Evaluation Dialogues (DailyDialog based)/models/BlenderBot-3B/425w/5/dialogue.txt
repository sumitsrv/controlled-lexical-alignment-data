Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that! Do you miss him/her?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I miss her a great deal. She just started catching and eating mice at least once a day.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would just go anywhere where I could take her and feed her great catfood.  Cats are my favorite companionship.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would go where there are a lot of wildlife and lots of cats.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 That sounds awesome and scary at the same time.  I'm curious about how you heard that as rainforests are usually very cold.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I heard about one on a travel show and then I just thought that the zipline sounds incredible.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 haha, just a wild and scary image you know. Don't even make me think about ziplines where you can get stuck lol
