Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Pretty good and how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 its going good and ready to watch a game I'm a basketball fan
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I did not. How good are the Grizzlies?
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I'm the same way with all these naming conventions, I'm more of a hockey fan myself. Who's your favorite team?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 I love the New York Chairs. What's more original than naming them the New York Chairs?  Do you have other name
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 I'm all about the New York Chairs!  The name is a joke that came about with a comedian I watch in 2002 called
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure but that's pretty cool, is that something they say in the New Yorker all the time?
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Yes that was the movie about that sentient chair! I saw that once, scary! Did you ever see it??
