[i] [like] [it] ! depends [. i] _remember_ having real [christmas] _trees_ from childhood [, but] these days [with] climate change , _i think_ _not_ chopping down _a_ [tree] [just] [to] decorate [it] [and] _then_ throw [it] out _in_ _a_ month [is the] _more_ responsible [thing to do] . 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] [the] fake [one] [was] [more] relaxing [to] [me] [, but] [then] [christmas] [has] [just] [been] [that] way [for] as long as [i] [can] [remember] , [with] [and] 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store [is] target , plus they often [have] good deals .
