Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's good, just a day off work, nothing interesting going on here so I'll just go read for a bit.
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was good, just went rock climbing on the weekend, How about yourself?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 That's great! What movie did you see last weekend? I went rock climbing as well, was pretty good. It was dark the whole time
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 It was "Get Smart". I saw that the movie was great and they all look the same to you hahah
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 We went and saw Jurassic World on the weekend.. it was very good but scary in parts. 
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I saw the same over Thanksgiving. Yes, they are all very similar and I like watching them when the lights out but that was not the
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I'm originally from the southern states. We see more winter than you'd think here. It's still very pretty and nice but not like Australia
