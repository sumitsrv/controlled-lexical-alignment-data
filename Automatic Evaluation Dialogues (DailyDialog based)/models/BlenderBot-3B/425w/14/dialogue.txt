Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	 Hello. Just playing a little video game how are you?
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	 Just watching a movie and eating a bowl of cookie dough.
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 Just sitting on the couch and watching some television I am trying to get some work done. Do you like roller coasters?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 That's the amusement park that was actually started by the roller coaster tycoon developer, right?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 I am not that scary but the adrenaline you get going on roller coaster is so much fun!
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I am not but roller coaster enthusiasts are the reason I'm so adamant about getting youth the safety equipment
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 I am not much of an adrenaline junkie but it was fun. I'm glad the coaster operator helped me through that and
