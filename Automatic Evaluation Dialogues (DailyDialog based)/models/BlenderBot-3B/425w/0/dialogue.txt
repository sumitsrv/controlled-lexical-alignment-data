Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 I get to meet lots of people at work on the weekends, where I work in the retail section of a store.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Wow! That's quite a lot, what are you doing different on that one?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia was very fun. Whats your favorite one?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 Yeah it's really fascinating and people are so quick to judge but the reality is usually what matters to them most are what they think of themselves or
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 The people are so mean here and they don't think it's fair what they call you but usually I get used to it.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 It's fascinating and I think you're right it really matters what people think of themself, but spooky is the right word to use
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 Not really I'm not much for hunting and have never done it but if my husband wanted I wouldn't say no if you know what I mean...
