Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well! Just playing a little Xbox
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, just got done cleaning up and you?
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I work outside but it's so hot that I enjoy going indoors sometimes when there are no bugs
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I like movies. Do you work outside that's cool? I'm a little bit of a homebody but love it
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I love action movies but there are never any cool ones that have Terminators outside.
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 Yeah, movies are cool but you never know what's really going to happen, only the actors will haha
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 haha that's cool, it's not for everyone. It's like the end of time
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 not much spoil you want to know? it's a thriller movie that will get at your soul, there the ending didn't surprise me at all
Human 1:	 Thanks!
