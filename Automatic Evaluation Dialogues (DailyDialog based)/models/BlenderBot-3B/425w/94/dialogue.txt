Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 I had lunch, just had a huge pile of rice, it tasted kinda like pork. Have you ever had it at that dish
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 I did and it had what we were told were beef.  It was really pig.
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm a vegetarian and some shrimp sounds interesting for lunch. How did you prepare it?
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I was just having some chicken and vegetables for lunch. It was the shrimp that made me pause though.
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I'm sorry you had a bad lunch. Was the sandwich pretty good though? I like them vegetarian but it's tough. I usually mix
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I have not but it does look pretty tasty. What kind of food are you going for the buffet?
