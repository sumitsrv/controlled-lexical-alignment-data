A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm _trying_ to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ am [great] _thanks !_ [it's] almost [croissants] _time_ ! _what_ are _you_ doing later this week ? 
A|4| Human 1: i've _done_ _them_ once _or_ twice so far _, _but_ they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . _i'm _trying_ to_ figure _out_ why . _what kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] chocolate chip [cookies] [but] _now_ [they] are [done] ! [what kind of] [croissants] are [you] [trying [to] make] ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , [thanks !] 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm trying] [out] _a_ chocolate chip cookie recipe . _the_ oyster [croissants] _that_ [have] [been] on _the_ market for ages [but] are 
A|8| Human 1: [now] [that] is [a] good idea . _i'll_ give it [a] _try_ next _time ._ would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'll] [try] [to make] [a] flax cookie [that] [you] can [have] on [sweet] [or] savory [but] _not_ both ! [what] about [you] ? 
A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , _i think_ i'd _eat_ pastries _all the time_ if [i] could get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [have] [that] [sweet tooth] [, but] [the] [people] who come over [eat] [them] [all the [time] .] [but they] [think] [i] cook [with] [too] much sugar 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was _when_ <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , _and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ [all] in [the] past . we [don't] [have] [sweet] tooths [when] we [eat] healthy [and] [try] _not_ [too] . 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
