Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 I am great thanks! It's almost croissants time! What are you doing later this week?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I have made chocolate chip cookies but now they are done! What kind of croissants are you trying to make?
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I'm trying out a chocolate chip cookie recipe. The oyster croissants that have been on the market for ages but are
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I'll try to make a flax cookie that you can have on sweet or savory but not both!  What about you?
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I don't have that sweet tooth, but the people who come over eat them all the time. But they think I cook with too much sugar
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I think that's all in the past. We don't have sweet tooths when we eat healthy and try not too.
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
