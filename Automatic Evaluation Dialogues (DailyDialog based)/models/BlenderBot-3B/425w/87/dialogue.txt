Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm just going to the beach with my family, what are you doing.
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm a reading book about the ocean called "Ship of Theseus." It is a great read, you should check out the series.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book that I just ordered for you.   It seems like a good read.
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I'm reading "Ocean's Eight" that is what the book is called. it gives tips on papers
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I am about to read the book and it's about ocean conservation and how it impacts human beings in a wide variety of ways.
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 I have read that book and it's a good book about the philosophy of research in science.
Human 1:	 yup!
