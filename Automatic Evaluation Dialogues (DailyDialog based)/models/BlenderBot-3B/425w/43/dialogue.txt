Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 I'm participating in this program the youth mentors are trying out, they are giving me some guidance on what to do.
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 I am doing the mentorship program as well! It is pretty cool. What are you guys getting them to learn about? How long do you
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 That sounds great. Is this a mentorship program for the youth you are training or just to have them participating in it?
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 We have one of them mentorship but sometimes the other one is pretty good too
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 It's actually 1:1! I have no idea about mentorship but it sounds great! What do you prefer?
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 I have been working with them all this year but I plan on expanding it next year. What are you mentoring on?
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
