Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I've been pondering the same scenario today
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I think you have good reasons for wanting to hang out with their friend now. I feel like they are the right person to invite you
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 I hope they are right for you too. But the friendship you have with your friends now might not sound like their former selves anymore.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I hope they invite you out for lunch the next time. That's a good way to bond with them again. I feel like friends are not
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 It's the opposite of treason because I am never good with that word lol it is like a friendship but you feel used
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I know what you mean! I'm the opposite too. It's hard for me to find balance with that word. People say it all the time
