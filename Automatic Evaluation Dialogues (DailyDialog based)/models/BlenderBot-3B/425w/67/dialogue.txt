Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I've skydived twice before, but never for a live action! How cool is that! I'm excited for you.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking! I'm so ready for this skydiving lesson but not sure where to go. Seville seems like a cool
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 Yes I've done it before. I love the feeling you get before you jump. It feels like you are falling, I have been skydiving
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I have never done it before so the adrenaline will be great
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I'm definitely not that great at skydiving! Have you tried any other extreme sports before?
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I tried once and fell down a slope. It was very scary the way water floods you and the way you can't see where you
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
