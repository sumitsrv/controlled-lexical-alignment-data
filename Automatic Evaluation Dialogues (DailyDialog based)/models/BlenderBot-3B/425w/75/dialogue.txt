Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 Hi there! It's Jenna! Nice to met you!
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 It's nice to meet you...I think so because the internet is a small place. Did you meet me on the dance floor?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 Hi Jenna, nice to meet you, too! Were you the guy who I met at the bar last week? It's crazy to think
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure. Did you have a good cardiologist last week?
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what that is either. Did you have any specialist? I do know that my primary care physician specialises in card
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you're referring to that's elitist but no, it was not me.
