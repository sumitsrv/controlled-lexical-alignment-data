Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Hokey really can be violent haha, wow that's great you are going on a hike though!
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 Hokey is the UFC?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I'm actually pretty out of shape but am going to give it a try this weekend to make sure I can still beat the sharks
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yes and there will be a bunch of people competing that you can beat out there. You should have fun!
