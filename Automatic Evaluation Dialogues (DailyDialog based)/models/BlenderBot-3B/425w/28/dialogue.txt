Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I'm great just listening to the beatles. What did you have for breakfast?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I had a healthier breakfast than usual, and I'm great. I just ate brownies instead of the eggs which are delicious.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat breakfast food and you?
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I would eat the food that I had for breakfast which was eggs and orange juice. That's what you think right? So what other foods do you
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I like that your question is theoretical and hypothetical.
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 Yeah like I'm talking about the other food you would eat that's not nutrition, just the taste and feel and texture
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
