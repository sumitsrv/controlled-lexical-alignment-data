Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 I was looking up reviews and saw someone say that this place had great chat and I was like, why the hell not.
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking for the best cigar bar.
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 I actually just moved from Peru about a month ago to the USA. I really miss it, but not the cigar smoke haha. Smo
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 Oh wow! So it's your first one? You're definitely the only person I've ever seen say they actually miss tobacco haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 You really only live once but you need that break from it. This is not the way I was supposed to go haha. I would say yes though
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 Oh yes haha it would be nice but only in a reincarnation that will allow for one more day of not having to live with my brain
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 I think it would be nice but we will see haha
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
