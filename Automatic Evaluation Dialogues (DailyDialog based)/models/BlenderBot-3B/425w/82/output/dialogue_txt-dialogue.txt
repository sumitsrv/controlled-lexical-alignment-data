A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: yo ! _what_ brought _you_ here 
A|2| Human 1: _just looking_ _to_ _chat_ . yourself ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i was_ [looking] up reviews and saw someone _say_ _that_ _this_ place had great [chat] and _i was_ like , why _the_ hell _not_ . 
A|4| Human 1: [i] am _just_ enjoying _a_ _cigar_ at [the] moment . how _about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [just looking] _for_ [the] best [cigar] bar . 
A|6| Human 1: [this] _one_ _is_ _actually_ _from peru_ , which _is_ _more_ _my_ taste . smoking isn't very healthy _, but_ _it's_ _actually_ quite relaxing , which _in a_ _way_ _is_ good [for] _your_ health . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [actually] [just] moved [from peru] [about] [a] month ago [to] [the] usa . [i] really miss _it_ [, but] _not_ [the] [cigar] smoke [haha] . smo 
A|8| Human 1: [haha] "you _only live_ once" as _they_ [say] ! 
B|9| Human 2: oh wow ! so [it's] [your] first [one] ? you're definitely [the] [only] person i've ever seen [say] [they] [actually] miss tobacco [haha] 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , [that] _is not_ [what] [i was] getting at [, but] _yes_ [that] _would be nice_ . do [you] believe _in_ _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [you] really [only live] once [but] [you] need [that] break [from] _it_ . [this] [is not] [the] [way] [i was] supposed [to] go [haha] . [i] [would] [say] [yes] though 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] _think_ neural link _will allow_ [you] _to live_ after death ? [i] thought [it] [was] [just] [a] brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: oh [yes] [haha] [it] [would be nice] [but] [only] [in a] [reincarnation] [that] [will allow] [for] [one] [more] day of [not] having [to live] with [my] _brain_ 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] _see_ . [that] [is] [a] much harder task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [think] [it] [would be nice] [but] we [will] [see] [haha] 
A|16| Human 1: depends on how good [the] [brain] dump [is] [i] suppose ...
