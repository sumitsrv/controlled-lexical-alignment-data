Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Hi, How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 Oh I'm sorry to hear you are sick, what's the cause of your cold?
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I have been getting sick too! I'm allergic to this year's cold season for some reason. How is your home like?
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I have too much stress this year with the home stretch of finals and I think allergies are getting me. How long has youve been
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I love it there this time of year! It's just the humidity. But you just never know it can catch anyone like the flu.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I never have to put on lotion either! It's the beaches that do it for me, and getting out there this far to do tour
