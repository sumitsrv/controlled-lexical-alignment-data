Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	 Not going good... I have video editing software but I need the audio recorded...
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	 Its for a youtube video, you know how the internet goes! I have been working on it for a few months now. What can I use?
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	 What kind of music you like?  I use iMovie for video production.
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	 you are rockstar for using apple, do you use mac os
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 I play guitar myself! What kind of music you got in the works? 
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 I can't play them well at all, the chords are still weird for me, but this is guitar hero, you don't have to play
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 That's pretty cool you know how the guitar works, are you much better now? It's like alphabets for chords yes, can't
