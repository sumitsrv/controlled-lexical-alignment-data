A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ reflect back too much _on_ _things_ _, but i guess_ 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ me _in_ terms _of_ time spent _with_ _family and friends_ _and_ _work life balance ._ why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: well _it_ seems [you] [have been very] _good_ [with] your [work] [and friends] _this_ _year_ ! 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! _good idea_ _to_ _help_ people figuring out their _new year resolutions_ 🙂 _so_ _how_ do _i_ _get_ _a_ fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [don't] [have] _one_ [, but] _the_ [new year resolutions] [for] 2019 are [very] simple [and] [you] can [get] [help] _with it_ online 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if _we_ practice _that_ _! i think_ [the] _idea_ does [have] some potential _. how did you_ come up [with] _this idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [good idea] [for] sure [. how did you] feel [with] [the] [year] [that] [you] [have been] having ? 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] _is_ valuable [help] [for] [the] _community ._ _i think_ _mental health is_ [one] _of_ [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [i think] [i] [have been] [the] [one] [that] has [been] trying [for] [this idea] , [and] [i] was [the] [one] [that] thought [of] _it_ [, but i guess] [you] [did] 
A|10| Human 1: _that is_ actually _a_ quote stolen from my tl when [i] joined my first company after graduation . [i guess] _now_ after 5 yrs [of] [work] experience , [i] fully _agree [with_ it] 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: yes . [that is] _true_ [that] [mental health is] [so] important [for] [community .] [we] all need [to] [get] [on] [with] [one] another [. how] [you] [think] _about_ [this idea] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] _family and friends play a big role_ here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring _around_ [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] _busy_ ... [so] [on] 🙂 [what] [about] [you] ? [is] there _a_ _right_ answer [to] [this] ? :)

A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's_ [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also music earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [the] [right] spirit [! i think] [that] [this] thought [may] _be_ more important than [you] would [think] [with] all [the] [work] [and] [life] [we] [have] [around] us 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually not much [of] [a] reader . [i] usually hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original _thoughts_ 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] [a] [great] point [about] [the] [busy] [work life] [and] [how] [things] are changing , [family and friends play a big role] [in] happy [thoughts] [and] [that] keeps [you]
