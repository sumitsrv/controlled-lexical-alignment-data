Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 I just was busy today, it's always very busy on Mardi Gras day.  How was yours
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 My day was busy for the most part as far as being in the house doing the washing up and making dinner and such. How are you?
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 Europe was fun and busy! just got home, so now the next step is actually doing laundry
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 It was great for the most part until i had to stay home and watch the game, that was a long day.  I will go to Europe
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 It will make for a fun game too because the germany spanish team should have a much better shot with all their players but I still think
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
