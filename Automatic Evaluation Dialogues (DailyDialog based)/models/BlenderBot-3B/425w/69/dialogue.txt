Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	 It was pretty fun! But very exhausting, I did not realize it would be that large. How about yours?
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 Turkey week was last week, so all the kids ate turkys and my party was pretty lame
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	 It was very funny! But a lot of work, I had to prepare all the sides like bread, salads, fruit and muffins
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 Turkey was from home cooked, but you got to admit - you did make them eat like your guest were family haha
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 Hahaha you are the cook of the family with that one, always making Thanksgiving dinner for us.
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 Haha, Thanksgiving is always fun and delicious.  My daughter had turkey with the family last year, as she got a lot more attention
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 I did have fun and was not that big on the pets either, but the turkey was very delicious.
