Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I'm great. I'm going camping tomorrow and it's a day off from work! How about you?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I'm going to class, just working on my assignments. What time is your day off?
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I'm great! I work full time but take classes part time at college. Are you working or going to class? 
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 I get the day off work because I'm an employee, but all that time I was looking forward to the weekend, you like pottery class?
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 I'm working part time because I'm also studying college classes but I love pottery too the best and that's one reason. I like tea
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 I love all teas that are from tea plantations!  A lot like you I take classes part time as well and would like to one day
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 Yes that would be cool! The teas are all from japan but the process of acquiring them is mostly different in different parts of the world
