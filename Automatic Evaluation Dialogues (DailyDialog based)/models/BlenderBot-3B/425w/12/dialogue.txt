Human 2:	 Hi good are you? My wife's been working very hard for the past few days
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where do you live?
Human 2:	 It's going good! Where are you and your wife right now?
Human 1:	 Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....
Human 2:	 It was 114 degrees the other day! It's hotter here now. Where are you located?
Human 1:	 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!
Human 2:	 I live in the northern Midwest of Japan, I love it, but it is hot during summer. It's nice you've been
Human 1:	 Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
Human 2:	 I went to the Kyoto and Tokyo area on a school trip, it was nice
Human 1:	 The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!
Human 2:	 I went on the Tokyo Disney Sea and all the different Disney hotels! It's a nice one haha.
Human 1:	 I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha
Human 2:	 I'm sure you are well aware of what the Tokyo Disney Sea really is which is pretty cool and unique to Japan but was there anything
