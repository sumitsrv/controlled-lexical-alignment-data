Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I watched Avatar but I can't remember what it's about, it's an animated film directed by James Cameron.
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 I watched it last week with the girlfriend, It's called Avatar 2. I have a few favorite but that movie is up there for sure
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I have seen the movie Avatar that's out on DVD recently, it's a beautiful movie with good story and good effects.
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 that movie with the blue people. it was really enjoyable
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 I like the food that you have and what it will do
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 What movie is that? I have not seen it. I prefer homemade noodle soup!
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 I like bake cookies and cakes mostly
