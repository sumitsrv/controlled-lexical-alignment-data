Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hi it's going well
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 its going way better than the morning and this day has been a roller-coaster so far but getting better
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 Oh that's the worst when that happens and they won't work on it until the morning, so now you are out of the way. The mechanic
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Did they say the mechanic is trying to figure out if that's supposed to happen and you don't drive today?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 That sounds good to me
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Haha, it was your faith that got them here in the first place! Did you get out of work today?
