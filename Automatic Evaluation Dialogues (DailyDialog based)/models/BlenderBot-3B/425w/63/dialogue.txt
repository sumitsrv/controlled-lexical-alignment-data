Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland is the BEST. I would go every trip for you if i could.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 We would love to but have to plan for the Christmas eve resort trip now - they are all booked up!
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 Great idea!  Disneyland might be the best resort!  I know it would be fun for Christmas.  Is your whole family going?
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 I sure hope that the drive can work but I'll look for Airbnb in Tampa. 
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 Yes that might work better for sure! It would surprise them and the eve can be christmas but then you have a night in Disneyland!
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 No, but your kids might think that too and you can take them the year after, this time of the year is getting close to christmas.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 I think this year are the little boys going to be so excited about getting that lego batman set they like. What would you think?
