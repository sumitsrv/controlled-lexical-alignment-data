Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Yeah pretty bad today.  I had to cancel my trip to the beach.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Well that sounds like raining bad and the beach is pretty much a gloomy place to go
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Where did you go? They had lots of rain this year.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 that's too bad. I can't wait for the weather to clear up.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I grew up there too that's the weather he has. Where are you from?
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 It was pretty interesting that the water supply here did change. It rained quite a lot. 
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
