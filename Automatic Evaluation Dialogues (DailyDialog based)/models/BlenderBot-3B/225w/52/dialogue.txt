Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 Hello, are they giving you goodies out today?
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 I needed a jacket this morning, that's for sure. I've been shivering the whole day.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 I guess that's good for the weather, but it was too cold for some outdoor activities for me today! Its been warm all week
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 Hi, sorry you are cold. It was really nice weather in the south. Where is it that you live?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live in the cold country for me. it's cold right now, but it should get better soon. you?
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 I live in the north east. Where they get hurricanes every year and flash rains that cause flooding. I can not wait
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
