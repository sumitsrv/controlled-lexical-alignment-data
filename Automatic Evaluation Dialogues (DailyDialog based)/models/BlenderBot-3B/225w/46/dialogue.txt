Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 Oh, I've been through the same thing before, what are you pondering?
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I feel the need to take sides because they are not good for each other at all.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That sounds like an interesting situation though. I hope they are not too hard to talk with because the friendship might suffer.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I'm not worried about being the friend to my friends. But they are so worried about their friendship with other people.
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 That's the best thing to hope for, I think it's always good to have a balance.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm a single mother with one son, but I know the feels. Lol.
