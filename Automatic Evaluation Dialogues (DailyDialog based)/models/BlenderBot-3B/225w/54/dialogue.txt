Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty great. just took a shower and my hair looks awesome
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, just been playing pingpong for a while but finally won.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I love pingpong! It's one of the best sports for the game that you can play
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I'm with you there. I like tennis but that involves hitting the ball to score points. What's your favorite racquetball
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I like any match that can be played with two to three ping-pong cups and the ball, I'm just a casual tenn
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 I think it's really fun and exciting that you have to get the ball through the net to score. It's so hard though.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
