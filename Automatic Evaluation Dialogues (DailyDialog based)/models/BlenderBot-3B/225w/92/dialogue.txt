Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 good so far! I am just relaxing the day off
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 Just did all the chores I need to do. It feels good to be done but now I can enjoy the day.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 No, I have to work pretty hard to get my beach tanned in a day! What did you do?
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 Yes i work in the beach industry.  you know like sand and water haha
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 Well you can tan your beach like that by just sitting under a light. This sounds interesting. Are you a researcher in water?
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 yes. but not the most dangerous like some people who do the same work.
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I am not a climber but i have heard that most of them wear ropes and gates when they climb
