Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Bruhhhhhh, you are talking to my future ex husband!!! Ll
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 My day was good, I am just getting ready to go to the gym now.
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that. What was your project?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I lost my mom when i was young and i've been through some similar stuff. I can say that you're doing a great thing for someone else
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 You were right about that one. But you're nice and I'm going to say your day was good, how's it going for you?
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 It's going pretty good I'm just waiting for it to get dark out so I can go for a run and get some dinner
