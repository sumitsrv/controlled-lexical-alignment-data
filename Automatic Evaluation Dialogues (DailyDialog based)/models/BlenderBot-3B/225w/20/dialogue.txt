Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 Hmm, tough one. Probably Mexican, that would probably be about the easiest to eat all day, but it's not the healthiest.
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 I would love to have some Asian food like in China, but too bad it's pretty hard to get there
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 Mmmm, that's a good one too. Chocolate is the best flavour. I love it with Cookies and Straw
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 I love all kinds of ice cream! I will have the vanilla or chocolate with any topping really, like chocolate sauce and chocolate bits on top
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 I love cookies and cream the best! What's your favorite kind? Chocolate ice cream or cookies and cream?
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 I do think there is something more, I have had the experience and I believe its what you have described. What's yours?
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
