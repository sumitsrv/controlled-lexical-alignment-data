Human 2:	 No I haven't. I'm still trying to catch up on the Marvel movies. I saw Iron man and the avengers in theat
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I've seen the movies and loved them. But don't watch it too much on the big screen.
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I didn't see that one either, not interested in the Marvel movies.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I've never seen any of the other Marvel movies either haha
