Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad too
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I'm sad too.   Posters are great idea. It has been a long day and I just want to get away from the catf
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would go anywhere outside, just so I could be far enough away from the city to where the noise wouldn't be distracting. What about you
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to go to Asia or South America where I could try the food from there!
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I would definitely take you zip lining there, sounds great. I love rainforests and going on long treks with my family!
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 you can't get there from where I'm at unless you are going to make me a one way flight.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 Lol ziplining does seem scary, and I think you should be afraid, there are no safety features in place to stop you from crashing
