Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 I have plans to relax with family, you?
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 It's actually not for me, but for my mother... she plans to have it over with all the thanksgiving dishes and have family time
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 I am not sure about any plans for thanksgiving. I think I may end up spending time with the family but we all live very far away
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 Yes, you may end up with a whole turkey for the family if your Mom decides to cook a big thanksgiving pie! 
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 That would be a great christmas! I wish i was that rich and could buy everything for the whole family with so few dollars.
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	 I would be so happy to find discounted clothes and electronics on the clearance rack, that's for sure
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
