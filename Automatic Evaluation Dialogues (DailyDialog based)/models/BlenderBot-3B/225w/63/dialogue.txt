Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland? I would never want to go there.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 I have been before! It's fun and the Christmas season would be a wonderful time for you.
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 That might be fun for the kids but I might have to pass. I will probably need a break from spending the holidays at Disneyland.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 It is going to be so fun for sure, that will be the plan.  It will probably be in the winter though
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I can't believe there are so many christmas traditions in the area. They have a christmas eve celebration, but not christmas
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 I can see that you are getting ahead of yourselves for sure. Whats the rush then?  
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 We are getting my son his first christmas present. Im not sure about his age but he's old enough that it should mean a bunch to him
