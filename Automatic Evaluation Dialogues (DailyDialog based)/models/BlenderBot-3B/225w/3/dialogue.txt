Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Hello, yes it is. It rained pretty hard today and all of my flowers fell over.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Oh no that is not fun! It rained pretty bad here too, the rain today.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 I don't like the rain too much either. They're water that falls and collects water when it lands.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 Haha the cloudy weather this morning here made me think that.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I grew up here in the south but I love the rain. It just never stops and there's so much to water
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 I did see that the last few days, have you ever been in a drought?
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
