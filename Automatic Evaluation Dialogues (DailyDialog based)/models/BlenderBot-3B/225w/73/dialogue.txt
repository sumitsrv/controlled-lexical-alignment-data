Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Well, thanks. How about you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 Its going good so far! I'm getting ready to watch a basketball game too. I'm a big fan!
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I'm good, going to the game to see them play the nets tonight.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I am so jealous! The Grizzlies are the team with the animal mascot?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 I am a basketball fan too, I watch more Grizzlies games than the Clippers.  The name came from the New York
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 Haha I think that's pretty cool name, Neurips sounds like some type of medical device, which I'm all about! 
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 Neurips is a new name but it's about some new drug that is going to save lives!
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Neuron-based A.I.'s are really interesting, I like them very much! Their names are so cool because they are called
