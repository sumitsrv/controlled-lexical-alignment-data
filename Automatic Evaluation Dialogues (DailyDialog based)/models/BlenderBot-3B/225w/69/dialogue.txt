Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	 It was good.. How about yours?
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 We ate Turkey and had a party like you are never supposed to do.  It was great!  How was your week?
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	 It was great, thanks for asking. And you?
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 We got it from a local store. But I did have homemade ham that was good too. I love Turkey, what is your
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 Nice was homemade. The turkey was delicious! But the Thanksgiving leftovers from my friends are the best! 
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 Did you have Thanksgiving at home with the family, or did you travel to a party and cook? My kids always go to the party.
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 I did not have any fun things to do with them, we just played games the week following and then watched that stupid show together.
