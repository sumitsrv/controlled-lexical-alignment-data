Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi there! it's a lovely day to chat with you
Human 1:	 Isn't it just! What are you up to today?
Human 2:	 Not much just hanging out with my family
Human 1:	 Oh, excellent! What does your son like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 He's been out of school for a week just like me! I am looking forward to it. I'm a teacher, but have been so busy
Human 1:	 I'm taking a fake sick day from work so I can go to the movies.
Human 2:	 I'm just enjoying the day, taking it easy, watching movies, eating junk food and watching some football. What about you?
Human 1:	 Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.
Human 2:	 I like seeing movies but it's hard when you work from home and you can't take the day off. I'm usually in bed by the time
Human 1:	 Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone. What's your favorite movie?
Human 2:	 I love movies but when I have the day off I'm with the family and can't even think about seeing one.
Human 1:	 Get out of town! It's Avatar too. What are the odds!?
Human 2:	 I love the movie Logan's Run and I don't think I could have any one to tell me it wasn't good with me at home
Human 1:	 Yes. Can't wait for the sequels.
