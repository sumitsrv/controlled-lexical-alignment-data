Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 the concept of not being able to attend lectures?
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	 the last few slides is an idiom
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 Yeah, the test was going good, then it slipped for some reason.  I feel not prepared for this one.
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 The last slides were not that bad for the test but the syllabus was tough, I over prepared for this test too much.
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 No kidding. I studied for the test like a madwoman! I feel that's not enough though. But still, here's to hoping
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 Yeah you were pretty spot on with that. I think I may have a shot though.
