Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's been a good day. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been good! I had a long day at work and the weather is great out today so I've been taking some time with friends.
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm great. It's been a long day with friends but I had some money put down so that was good. Deep sea fishing sounds
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 It's been going well, had some fun with friends as well. I like to fish on weekends but I'm thinking about hitting the lake
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I'm going on a nice weekend trip and there's deep sea fishing on the beach so that should be fun
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I've actually never been before. I think going on the beach would be fun because you can get some very nice pictures and a great view.
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I think the city itself would be nice but there's some nice spots outside like the lake
