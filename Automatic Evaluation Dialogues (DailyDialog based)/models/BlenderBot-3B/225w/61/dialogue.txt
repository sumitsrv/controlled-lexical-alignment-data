Human 1:	 What do you do to unwind?
Human 2:	 I'm not going to be able to unwind this month. I've been trying to make plans for two weeks and it's just not happening.
Human 1:	 Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.
Human 2:	 Yeah Pokémon is great you have never heard of it?
Human 1:	 In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that’s why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?
Human 2:	 Have you ever seen the ponies that are also known as Pokemon? I love them and my little sister does not know about them.
Human 1:	 What is your favorite show to watch right now?
Human 2:	 I used to watch that when I was little! I think the first season came out in the 90's
Human 1:	 I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.
Human 2:	 There are ponies and pokemon, you must be so old.
Human 1:	 Do you like cats or dogs better? Do you have any pets?
Human 2:	 I like ponies better, and I have one that I named Ladybug.
