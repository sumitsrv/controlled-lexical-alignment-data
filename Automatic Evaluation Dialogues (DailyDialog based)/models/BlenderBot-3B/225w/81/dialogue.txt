Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	 I just came back from skiing as well, did you take your family?
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 that sounds fun and terrifying haha. I took my boyfriend but he slammed me into the ice wall in the first turn, he was so
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	 My french is basically a high school level but im still trying to improve. I just came back and was a little shaky from the slope
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 No but my brother got to take me for a ski trip to a french resort that was nearby.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I know nothing but the most commonly used phrases and words that I've forgotten. Did you ski anywhere else after that?
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I've always wanted to ski but know that I don't have the coordination to pull it off.
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 No i can just ski the downhill skiing but that is about all I do
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
