Human 2:	 Just a music video for the youtube channel I do, not a famous one you will ever see. What kind of guitar are you learning?
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 Just the guitar, but for the chords they are bar chords. I play lead guitar. Yeah its a long time though.
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 yes, i just do the guitar for youtube, like you i can't play a long time either lol
