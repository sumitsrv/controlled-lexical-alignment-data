Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	 I am a lot happier than usual. I was worried for a bit.
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that, I have been there. How has work been treating you?
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	 I'm a student and I have been sick so I stayed home today.
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	 I'm always sceptical that this game and the players we have to deal with would actually work. But, we are going for a week.
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 the literature says that acupuncture is a form of physical and mental therapy
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	 I'm the same way, that is why I was so shocked that he did actually healed me. Lol
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure who the author was but it's been around for quite a while now. It's amazing you were willing to give it a go
