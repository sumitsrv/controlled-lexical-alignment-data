Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I had a great time, and I feel happy about the improvements!
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 No but the marathon is my favorite event. I'm training for it right now
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 Hi! Well the marathon is not really my speed but I like to race in the 5K and 8K events.
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 It's cool. I like the obstacle courses where you race for your life and not time
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 How long have you been training for Sparta? It has one of the longest running running events and is an annual event.
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 It's been about the same amount of time as you, for sure. I did one in Spartan Race Wisconsin back in
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 It's cool you can workout with the Spartan Race which I was part of for 4 1/2 months training
