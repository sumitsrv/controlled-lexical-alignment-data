Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey sup
Human 1:	 not much. any plans this weekend?
Human 2:	 I'm planning on visiting my parents this weekend and we are going to take a long drive through the countryside. You?
Human 1:	 ziplining?
Human 2:	 I'm not much too, just hanging around the house all weekend and doing ziplining.
Human 1:	 i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience
Human 2:	 I have not done ziplining since I was a kid - what's it like?
Human 1:	 i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though
Human 2:	 No it's not local.  It was actually one where you have to jump out of a zipline and glide downwards with the wind
Human 1:	 that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you
Human 2:	 that's hard i'm glad you are gonna do it though and try not to have a panic attack while you are doing it!
Human 1:	 no, i'm going to get a massage first
Human 2:	 i'm going in a couple of weeks and it's my first time! i've been so scared that my hands might get sweaty. Have you
Human 1:	 traditional kind
Human 2:	 No I haven't but I think traditional massage is much better and relaxing compared to the one I'm going to get
Human 1:	 you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!
Human 2:	 Yeah it can feel great if you're relaxed and don't get the hands dirty. The first time I had one, I was kind of nervous
