Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Nothing much you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 Nothing much you the same, this time last night was fun, how about you?
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 Oh it was the longest time I've been without seeing him since like middle school, lol! It was awkward but fun. 
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh it was the longest time as well, really. And yes things have changed recently.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Well, things have been more exciting for sure! A lot of friends have been moving in the last week but its like being a kid again.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 That sounds really exciting, you like adventures? 
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 My Saturday routine is playing board games like chess, video games, and watching movies. What do you do for fun?
