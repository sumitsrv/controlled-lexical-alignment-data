B|5| Human 2: it's [been] [going] [bad] [for] _my_ health _, but_ at [the] same time , [better] [to] [just] rest [and] [relax] , [you're] right . there [was] [a bug] 
A|6| Human 1: definitely ! _i know_ [a] lot _of_ folks travel _for _the_ holidays_ [, but] i'm happy [to] stay _home_ myself ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i know] what [you] mean . _my_ [holidays] _have_ [been] [bad] [but] [for the] [better] _, i_ [want [to] relax] [and] _not_ _think_ about _it_ much !

A|12| Human 1: buying [a] _tree_ _is_ [a] neat experience [. i] [was] torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake _one_ vs . [a] real _one_ [that] _smells_ [like] fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for the] _one_ [that] we [can] disassemble _every_ year . 
B|13| Human 2: [i have] [the] fake [one] [too] [but] [the] [smells] [and] [lights] [that] can't [come] _down_ [for] [a] while are driving [me] crazy 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , [very] clever pun ! [i like] [it] ! depends [. i] remember having real _christmas _trees_ from_ childhood [, but] these days with climate change [, _i] think_ [not] chopping [down] [a] _tree_ [just] [to] decorate [it] [and] then throw [it] _out_ in [a] month _is_ [the] _more_ responsible thing [to] do . 
B|15| Human 2: [i like] [the] [trees from] [christmas tree] festivals because [i think] _they_ [have] [more] color [and] decorations . [but] [for] [every] holiday it's 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store _is_ target , plus [they] often [have] _good_ deals . 
B|17| Human 2: [yes] , [the] smell [of] [christmas trees] [is very] [good] [and] [they] [have] _a nice_ decoration [and] [lights] [that] [can] be [put] [out] year-round [for the] 
A|18| Human 1: great [, i] hope [you] find [a nice] [tree] .
