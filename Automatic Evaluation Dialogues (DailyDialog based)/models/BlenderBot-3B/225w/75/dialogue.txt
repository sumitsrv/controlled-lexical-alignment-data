Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 It's so hard to remember!  It was a long time ago.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 It's definitely possible! Did you dance at Coney Island in the 90's?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 I don't think it was you but it's always crazy how small the world can be!  Did you have a great time?
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm sorry you didn't have a good time. You are a cardiologist. I'm in the medical field as well.
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what that is either. My husband is the cardiologist. I have no idea what it's like. Do you work
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I know, right? I'm not sure what that's supposed to be either? I don't but have had the job for a long time!
