Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great! What game so you play for?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I play soccer for fun with friends but I'm not great at it lol. Soccer is also a group sport.
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I would prefer to exercise with you but I am not sure if they'll want to play with me either. I'm thinking about getting a Switch
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I am not into it much but it's a nice toy to play with friends for sure. It has online play.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I'm not much into it either but the Switch game's like Mario Odyssey are just fun for some people
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 I would like to read the book you suggested it's good?
