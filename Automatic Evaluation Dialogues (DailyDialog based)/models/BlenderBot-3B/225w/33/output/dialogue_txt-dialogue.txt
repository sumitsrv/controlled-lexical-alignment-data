A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thanks] _and_ [croissants] are fun [to make] ! do _you_ like french _pastries_ ? 
A|4| Human 1: _i've done them_ once _or_ twice so far _, but_ _they_ haven't _been_ flakey enough . [i'm] _trying to figure out_ _why_ . what kind _of_ _cookies_ _have_ [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ love [cookies] [made] [of] buttercream 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , [thanks] ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ [make] [cookies] _and_ breads [, but] [i've done them] _all_ at one _time_ [or] another . [it's] _a_ lot [of] fun [trying to figure out] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ _is_ [a] good idea . _i'll_ _give_ it [a] _try_ next [time] . would [you] say [you] _have_ [a] sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i'll] [have] [to] [try] [that] ! [i've] [been] [trying to] perfect _the_ butter [cookies] - [they] [make] [great] frosted [cookies] _and_ [give] [them] 
A|10| Human 1: some _people don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , _i think_ i'd _eat_ [pastries] [all] [the] [time] if [i] _could_ get away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i think] [people don't] [give] [them] [to] children because [they] [think] [they] [have] [too] much sugar ? [but] [you] [could] always [eat] [the] cookie [with] milk , which 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] _fat_ substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [people] [have] eaten [too] many [pastries] _that's_ [why] [the] [fat] [and] sugar [is] [all] over [the] news lately . [the] media [is] [trying to] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
