Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	 I head home too you know. 
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	 It will, but at least I have vacation after that.
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	 I have some plans too. Its just that I've never done the tentative vacation home thing before.
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	 I'm based out of Los Angeles but will be taking a vacation to New York in January. Where are you going?
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	 We are driving to San Francisco and to the golden gate bridge, but since it is raining it will only last the night. 
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	 It is raining cats and dogs here as well.  The house was down the block from the beach last week and has been flooded
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
