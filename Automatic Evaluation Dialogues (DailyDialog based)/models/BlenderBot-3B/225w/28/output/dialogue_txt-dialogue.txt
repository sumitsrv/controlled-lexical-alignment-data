B|13| Human 2: [the] [food] [i] _have_ _is_ basically [like] [soylent] _green_ . but without [the] corn [and] [other] nutritional stuff [you] probably wouldn't [want to] 
A|14| Human 1: oh , too easy ! try [the] [green] hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] [green] [and] [the] plates [are] [green] too .
