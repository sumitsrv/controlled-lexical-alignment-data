Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I love breakfast. What did you have?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I had eggs and toast for breakfast, and I'm not afraid to admit that!
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat breakfast food that my mom always used to make when i was growing up
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 Soylent Green would be the one I'd want to eat. It's just food that tastes like what it has those ingredients and nut
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I've never had Soylent! what's the appeal? I've read the food guide and it talks a lot about how the main product is
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 The food I have is basically like Soylent Green. But without the corn and other nutritional stuff you probably wouldn't want to
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
