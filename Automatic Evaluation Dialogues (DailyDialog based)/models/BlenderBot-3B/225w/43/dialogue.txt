Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 I have a mentor in the program but he's a new grad so he doesn't really know much.
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 That sounds useful! Mentorship is great for mentoring and helping you learn.
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 I have been a mentor the past few years, but this time was my first as a full-time student and a teaching one
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 I have a good program but sometimes 1:1 is more beneficial I think. I prefer the other kind because I feel I learn more by having
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 I agree. Mentorship is great at the beginning of a program, but you have to find someone good to mentor you and be there
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 It would have been cool to learn with you but i guess this time it is the other way around, i'll stick to working with kids
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
