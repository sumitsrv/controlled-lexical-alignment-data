Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Hi, I came for the chat and stayed for a long time. I love this sub so much, it is so welcoming and friendly
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Just enjoying the summer, its about to be over and I have a lot of school to get to and just looking for chat on here
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 I just got home from the beach but it was quite hot actually, Peru would be nice for a cigar.
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 You must live by the beach. I like your style! 
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 You are not the only one that would enjoy it but i know they say you can live more then once, and it was nice talking to you
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 I think that would allow for me to live more but I just don't believe in it. It's not like you can tell the future so how
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 You would think that but you never know, it could be just an illusion. That's what I thought at first. I was quite amazed
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
