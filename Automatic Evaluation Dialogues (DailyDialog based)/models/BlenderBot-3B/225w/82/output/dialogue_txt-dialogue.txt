A|4| Human 1: [i] am _just enjoying_ _a cigar_ _at_ [the] moment . _how_ _about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [just enjoying] [the] summer , its [about] [to] _be_ over and [i] have [a] lot of school [to] get [to] and [just looking] _for_ [chat] _on_ here 
A|6| Human 1: [this] _one_ [is] _actually_ _from_ _peru_ , which [is] _more_ my taste . smoking isn't very healthy , _but_ _it's_ _actually_ _quite_ relaxing , which _in_ [a] way [is] good [for] _your_ health . haha 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [just] got home [from] [the] beach [but] _it was_ [quite] hot [actually] , [peru] _would be nice_ [for] [a cigar] . 
A|8| Human 1: haha "you _only_ _live_ once" as _they say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: _you_ must [live] by [the] beach . [i] like [your] style !

A|12| Human 1: do [you] _think_ neural link will _allow_ [you] _to live_ after death ? _i thought_ [it was] [just] [a] brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [think] [that would] [allow] [for] me [to live] [more] [but] [i] [just] don't [believe in] [it] . [it's] [not] like [you] can tell [the] future so [how] 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] see . [that] [is] [a] [much] harder task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: [you] [would] [think] [that] [but] [you] never know , [it] could [be] [just] an illusion . that's [what [i] thought] [at] first . [i was] [quite] amazed 
A|16| Human 1: depends [on] [how] good [the] brain dump [is] [i] suppose ...
