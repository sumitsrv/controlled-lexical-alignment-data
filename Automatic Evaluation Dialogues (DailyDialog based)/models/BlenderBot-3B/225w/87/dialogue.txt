Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm great!  I just got back from a trip to the beach
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book The Fault in Our Stars, its about love and relationships, are you looking at the ocean?
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I am reading that book yes its really good. Its called the fault in our stars.
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I've read that book, but it's been a good while. Have you read The Giver? I'm reading that one at the moment,
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I have read that in school. It's about being and adult and growing up, but it's good for young adolescents too.
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 the book's also about a dystopian future and being a contrarian in that kind of situation, which was well written?
Human 1:	 yup!
