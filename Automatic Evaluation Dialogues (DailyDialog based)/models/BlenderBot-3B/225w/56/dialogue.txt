Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	 Not food in particular, but I am craving a nice glass of warm apple cider.
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	 Hello! Nice to know you're on such a good sleep schedule! Ramen is what I crave most too! Do you like any food
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	 I'm not a fan of Ramen at all, but I do love a lot of other Japanese food like miso soup and the like
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	 I have not been to any San Mateo Ramen places, but my daughter and her husband like the Konichiwa R
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	 No but my sister has and she said they do Japanese fusion cuisine. Mateo Ramen, which are like the top
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
