Human 2:	 Just a weekend trip to the casino!
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	 Hi, i was there all weekend. The whole city. How was your trip?
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	 It was pretty good. I just went to a big party and did some gambling. What are the cooking classes for?
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	 I've never heard of cooking classes with zucchini as the food - does it taste like pumpkins at all?
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	 they cooked some sort of vegetarian dish with zucchini and it was actually delicious, it was the first time I had had it.
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	 It's a family holiday in Italy and the meal will be for over 100 people and they love it! Italians use them in lots
