A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ _reflect_ back _too_ _much_ on _things_ , _but _i_ guess_ 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ _me_ _in_ terms _of_ time spent _with_ _family and_ _friends_ _and_ _work_ _life_ balance . _why_ _do_ [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: _not much_ [too] [reflect] [with] [work] [but] [family] [life] . [but i] [have been very] _busy_ as well [and] [things] going okay 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! _good_ idea _to_ _help_ _people_ figuring _out_ their _new year_ resolutions 🙂 _so_ _how_ _do i_ _get_ _a_ fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [good] ! [and] [you] just [get] [out] _there_ [and] [have] [a] [new year] [with] [how] [much] [you] enjoy [life] ! 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ _! i_ _think_ [the] idea _does_ [have] some _potential_ _. how_ did [you] come _up with_ [this] idea ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [have] [the] same question [too] [. how] [does] _one_ [get] [out] [that] door _when_ [you] are [too] exhausted [and] [don't] [have] anything [to] offer [people] . 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] is valuable _help_ _for_ [the] community _. i_ _think_ _mental health_ is _one of the_ bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: well _, i_ thought [that] [people] [don't] [have] [the] [potential] or [mental health] [for] _it_ [and] [this] was [one of the] few [things] [that] can [help] them _out to_ 
A|10| Human 1: [that] is actually [a] quote stolen from _my_ tl _when i_ joined _my_ first company _after_ graduation _. _i_ guess_ now _after_ 5 yrs [of] [work] experience [, i] fully _agree_ [with] [it] 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: _that's_ [the] thing [! i] [don't] [get] [out] [much] [but] [when i] [do i] [work] [with] [people] [and] [i guess] [after] [a] while [you] just [think] [that] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . _stay_ happy; [i] [think] _family and_ _friends_ _play a_ big _role_ here . 2 . _meaningful work_ life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . _multiple_ _hobbies_ [that] _keep_ [you] [busy] ... _so_ on 🙂 [what] about [you] ? is [there] [a] right answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: it's [so] important [to] [stay] healthy [and] [keep] [up with] your [mental health] , _that's_ [why] [there] are [multiple] [mental health] professionals [you] can talk [to] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! [that's] [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also music earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [great] [that] [you] [have] found [meaningful work] [and] [a] [family] [to] [play a] [role] [in] [life] ! [how] long [have] [you] [been] [there] ? 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually [not much] [of] [a] reader _. i_ usually hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [i] [agree] [. i] [do] [not] [stay] [in] [much] [but] [that's] because [my] [family and] [life] [with] [friends] [keep] [me] [busy] [. i] [do] [think] [hobbies] are [the]
