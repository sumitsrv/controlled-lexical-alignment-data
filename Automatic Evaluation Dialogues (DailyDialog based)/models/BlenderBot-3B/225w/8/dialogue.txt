Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 It has been great just got back from vacation
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry, get better soon
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I have been sick for the last 3 days, even with all this cold weather, I feel better today
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I have plans for the weekend and even though I've been sick this morning, I am already looking forward to getting home!
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I never get sick there. It's beautiful and the locals are super humble.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I love the beach so much. It's been so humid here the past few days.
