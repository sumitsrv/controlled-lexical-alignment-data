Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 I realized when I was a little girl that I love to bake pastries, it's an enjoyable work
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 Hey how are you I'm not psychic but my guess was right, you said that already
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I'm not a psychic! I wish I was too be able to feel the future haha... and you're funny
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 Are you a pastry chef that specializes in cake baking?  I'm not familiar with the term, or the different types of past
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I enjoy baking cakes for people that are not eating the cake and I am good, but am not a baker by profession 
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 I'm the same.  My favorite are the brownies and fudge cake with vegetables and chocolate chips
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I make cakes for the cafe that I work at, which is a nice job, we are very busy and my coworkers love me
