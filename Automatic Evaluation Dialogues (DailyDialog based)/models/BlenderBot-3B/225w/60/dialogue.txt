Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 good day, I had dinner with the family, It's a nice restaurant.  I love that place.
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was great. I went climbing and rock climbing the day before with a friend. Have you ever done that stuff before.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 That's fun! Yes, I went rock climbing with friends when the weather was nice. It's great exercise. What movie did you see?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 I saw the movie that was coming out last week "The Witch" about a supernatural and very creepy ghost.
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 That's awesome. I was out there all day. I saw the new scary movie. it was good and creepy but not very scary.
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I've been meaning to see it but I was really busy. But the good reviews had me going to go. It's out in Australia already,
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 Australia was nice but definitely scary. I am not the least bit scared of the outdoors but it's very dark and the beach is too
