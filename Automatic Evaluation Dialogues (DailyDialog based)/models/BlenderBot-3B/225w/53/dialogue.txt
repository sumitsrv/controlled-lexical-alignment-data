Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty good. I was able to finish work in time and get a break before the busy time.
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I have lots of plans that weekend.  I am trying to work on the new website for our business I started with my wife before we go Thanks
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Haha! I like to play games for fun you know, have you any plans?
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I like to run, too. My husband and I are getting married before the year is out. I just have to find a venue.
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 Well I like to run!  I just ran my first marathon last week!  Congratulations on you being married and I've always
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 You sound like you have a lot of passion for marathons! I am looking forward to it since I know it involves long distances
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I was looking forward to running one every year until this year. It wasn't going to be like the others. I was really looking foward
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 I bet that was a tough one to complete.
