Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	 I have plans to go to the mall this afternoon for a christmas shopping spree.
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	 Christmas day is the biggest family day in Norwegian culture but for me its just a work day and I have to get up early!
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	 Where are you going for your Christmas shopping?  I will be home with the family watching American Horror Story and then just playing with my cat
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	 Where you will have to see family? How did you and your family get together on the holidays before?
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	 Oh volunteer work must have been fun and cool to build a home for the holidays. I only was working. What did you build
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	 It was and it was very peaceful
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	 I was not using a non-profit organization but they provided the venue and food for the event 
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
