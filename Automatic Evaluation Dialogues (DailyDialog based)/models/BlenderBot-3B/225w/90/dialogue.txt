Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I think I would like that, especially if I got to watch badminton. But I am not sure my schedule is going to work for me
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 That would be fun, have you participated before?
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 I have and you should, its very fun and very social event. I like the events where you get out for a day and volunteer and
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 the youth badminton event, I have gone a couple of times and like it a lot. There are other events like the beach ones
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 I have not, but for sure will next week, the place is pretty fun. Its on saturdays and its a little before sunday
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 That would be awesome!  The next event is the youth badminton and its on sunday.
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 Well you have some helpers for the organizing. The event is next saturday and it's with a few other friends.
Human 1:	 Thanks.
