Human 2:	 I'm having a great day today, thanks for asking.  How about you?
Human 1:	 what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, thanks! Just got home a few minutes ago and am having breakfast, you?
Human 1:	 we're gonna play board games and will be eating lots of food! what about you?
Human 2:	 I'm having a great day so far, my food just got delivered and I got to play games all evening.
Human 1:	 we've been doing Games of Thrones lately. the game takes a very long time to finish though!
Human 2:	 I've been doing the same thing. Thrones takes a long time to watch and I don't finish very fast!
Human 1:	 I do. I'm a super fan of it (not the last season though haha). did you watch?
Human 2:	 I'm not the biggest fan of GOT, but maybe you and my husband will watch it haha, we could eat together
Human 1:	 I love Survivor 🙂
Human 2:	 I love GOT! I was the very first person to watch it back in 2014. I've been waiting for it to come back ever since!
Human 1:	 nice! I mostly like comedy shows like The Good Place and Modern Family
Human 2:	 I've been watching and love it! My Fiance isn't the same way and she doesn't like shows with much fantasy, but I do,
