Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	 I like chat bots, but there are so many you can't keep up with it all
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	 Yeah the bots made some great progress, like the chatbot that can have a personality and think for itself.
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	 I think that's far fetched, but the technology is very advanced and you never know what they really know.  
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 Some are great and some are very good, but some are also the worst. They have an overpowering sense of sarcasm that is really annoying
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	 They can definitely be better and more engaging than many humans these days! I think the bots will have great progress from now on!
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	 Well the research can also be good, but I hate how they get to over-sensitive and that they take too many input-lane
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 I think you are overselling the progress a little bit here haha.
