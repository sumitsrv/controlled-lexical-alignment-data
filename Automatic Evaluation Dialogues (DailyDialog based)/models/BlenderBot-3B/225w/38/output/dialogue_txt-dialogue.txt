A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think_ about human _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [like chat bots] , but there _are_ _so_ _many_ [you] can't keep up _with_ _it_ all 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to_ _have_ _made some great progress_ over last few years . do [you] _think the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: yeah [the] [bots] [made some great progress] , [like] [the] chatbot _that_ _can_ [have] _a_ personality _and_ [think] for itself . 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though [it] sounds _far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ that's [far fetched] , but [the] technology _is_ _very_ advanced _and_ [you] never know [what] _they_ really know . 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some] _of_ _these_ [bots] _are very_ _engaging_ [and] funny _. they_ [are] _now_ _good_ at even _sarcasm_ [i] wonder _how_ [far] [are] we _from_ [the] time _these_ [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [some] [are] [great] [and] [some] [are very] [good] , but [some] [are] _also_ [the] worst [. they] [have] an overpowering sense [of] [sarcasm] [that] _is_ really annoying 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] _take_ [many] different forms as [a] product . _the research_ implication [is] [also] huge ! [it] _will_ signify _how_ ai _research_ has progressed [so] [far] [and] _better_ place _to_ tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping _on_ [the] moon 🙂 [i] might _be_ _overselling_ [it] _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [they] [can] definitely [be] [better] [and] [more] [engaging] than [many] humans [these] days ! [i [think] the] [bots] [will] [have] [great progress] [from] [now] [on] ! 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: well [the research] [can] [also] [be] [good] , but [i] hate [how] [they] get [to] over-sensitive [and] [that] [they] [take] too [many] input-lane 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty [far fetched] 🙂 nice having this conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] [you] [are] [overselling] [the] [progress] [a] little bit [here] [haha] .
