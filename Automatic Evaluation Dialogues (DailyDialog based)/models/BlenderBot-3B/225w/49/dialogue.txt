Human 2:	 I watch it live the weekend festival was so much fun! 
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 That's good you are going to the festival, what are you going to get into? I love Hokey, but can be violent
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 I actually like watching UFC the fights and will be going to this weekends event.  Hokey can be violent, but live theater
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I really like the UFC and just started training myself but am still pretty new.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah I bet you will do just fine! You should give it a try and have fun and put your all into it, I am pretty sure you
