Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Just going to work, but it's always good to chat with someone. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 I broke down and the shop fixed this morning getting me home so that I could work the day
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 That's so awesome! What did the mechanic figure out?
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Did they find the problem with your moped today?  You can pick me up but you need to let me drive you here lol
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 That sounds good. I think you should drive me to work today!
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Haha don't you think that's a but far fetched? You should drive your moped and see the game. Maybe even come out here
