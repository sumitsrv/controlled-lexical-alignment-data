Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm doing well. I've been bitten by a new cat a few times today, which is sad.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I'm sad and I have also just tried banging her catfood dish! What a coincidence.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I'm well. Sorry about your cat. I would love to vacation anywhere where you can see the great outdoors and swim!
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to just vacation there where you have rainforests and areaches and can see lions and giraffes
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 right now where I'm thinking about going sounds great.  are you from there?
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I'm not. I just really want to one day and would like to see one.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 I'm from there and one of the rainforests in Brazil. Don't drink and zipline mate, its not that great.
