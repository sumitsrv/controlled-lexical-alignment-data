Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Yeah, pretty bad. But I can deal with it!
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Its gloomy today.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Yeah, the rain is not much fun. It is too bad that water is a major issue this year.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 It has been pretty bad, that's the first time it rained in days. We don't like rains too much
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 That's the same here but there have been several days that it had been raining so much I have had to go sit on a bench and people
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 that was interesting, did you ever see the drought in houston this year? They had water rationing there.
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
