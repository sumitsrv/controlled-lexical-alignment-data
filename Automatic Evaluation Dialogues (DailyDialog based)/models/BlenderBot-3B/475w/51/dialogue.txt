Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's good. I'm about to take the horse to the veterinary today.
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been a great long while since I had horse racing! Catching up with friends usually means watching some good old sports like football and so
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 It's been great I'm going to put that down some money to go fishing with friends. How long had it been?
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 Deep sea fishing sounds like fun. I'm going that with some friends once in a while. Just got our boat in May. Have any
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I'm going down there with some friends that have been before. It really excites me. How long you been down deep sea fishing?
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I like the sea because its deep and there are fish you can't see in most lakes or ponds. about 10 years
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I've been there about 3 years. What's the deep sea have you been down?
