Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hello! It's going well so far
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	 Its going well. How about you?
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	 Civil War? I didn't realize that the United States were fighting in a civil war! :O
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 No it was the Civil War that's history is taking place right now you know. Are you learning a lot about it in History class
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	 Well the Civil War ended in 1861 so you know what? Apparently it didn't go that well for those who lost!
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 My horse is named Civil War, the one that led to slavery being abolished by the Confederates.
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	 That sounds pretty cool!  Are you thinking about joining the military to fight for your country? What country, by the way, do you live
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	 No, I have my own money now, just very nostalgic about the horse and those who lost.  That's why I can't see
