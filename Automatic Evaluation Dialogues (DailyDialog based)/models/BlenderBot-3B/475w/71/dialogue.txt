Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Pretty good. How about you?
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 My day was great, but I am agony now thinking about not being able to have my favorite food.
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm sad and angry right now, my girlfriend broke up and she was the closest thing to me
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I am sorry for you loss! that's one of the few things I can say I've been through and it was hard. I loved her so
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry for your lost. Was some one was going to say that you?
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 It was pretty tiring, I'm going out for some drinks with some friends that I haven't really seen in a while, trying to help them
