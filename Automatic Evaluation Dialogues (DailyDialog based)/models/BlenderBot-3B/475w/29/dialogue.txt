Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Not bad! I am going to the grocery store after the gym. How about you?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I'm great, just enjoying this time off before class starts on monday
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I was working part time but now that I have some spare time, I'm going full time.  Are you going to take classes?
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 I am going to take some pottery classes but the college classes make more sense financially. It all depends how much time I can get.
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 It's great that you love tea. I would drink way too much if I was in your class.
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 A tea ware that I use mostly for drinking but also for decorative purposes and the like.
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 You are correct that the teas from different regions come out very differently. The japanese tea I like mostly because I need the caff
