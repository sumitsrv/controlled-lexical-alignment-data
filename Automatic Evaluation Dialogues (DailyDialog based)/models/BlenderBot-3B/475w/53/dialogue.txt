Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Its going great. I've been busy working and then I went to workout and now I just relaxed
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I am trying not to break any more things, that's the plans for the break!
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 I hope you have fun for the break that's like a few days? I am busy trying to finish up a couple projects
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I've started to run every weekday morning for the time, I just want to workout to burn fat to stay slim
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 Haha I can relate, I just want to lose weight, not trying to be the next Arnold though, haha
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I have been trying too. I run at least 4 miles a few times a week but I just have to like the long john's to put
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I run on the weekends, sometimes running long distances. I like to be fit though.
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 Well that's one thing that was tough for me. I like running long distances but have always been a bit chubby. Two days before
