Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty great. What game?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I'm very well, thank you for asking! It's good that you won even if you rarely do. What kind of game was it.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I won the game that's for sure but my wife just went back and got it and she's still not happy about it haha
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I like racquetball with a ball that's about the size of a softball but you have to hit the ball with your fingernails
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 It's like tennis mixed with basketball - very physical and requires a lot of skills. I'm not that great but I like to watch.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 That sounds fun and I don't think it's physical at all. What position do you play?
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
