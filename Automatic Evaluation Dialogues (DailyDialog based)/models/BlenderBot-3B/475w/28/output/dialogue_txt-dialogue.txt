A|4| Human 1: [i] had _eggs_ _and_ _hash browns_ . way less healthier than _your_ apple [, i'm] afraid ! 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm] good [and] [your] [breakfast] sounds [delicious] [. i] was [just] watching [the] news about [hash browns] [, which] _is_ basically corn , [eggs] , [and] 
A|6| Human 1: ha , that's _true_ . if [you] could _only_ _eat_ _one_ _food_ _forever_ , what _would_ it _be_ ?

B|9| Human 2: [i think] [the] [only] [food] [that] [would] make complete sense for [you] [and] [other] people [forever] [would be] [breakfast] muffins [which] _are_ [one [of] the] most eaten 
A|10| Human 1: brilliant [. _i] love_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i love] [the] [orange] color . [and] [soylent] [would] probably not turn [your] poop [orange] [which] [would be a] [great] [drawback] . 
A|12| Human 1: [that] depends . what sort [of food] [do you] feel _like_ ? 
B|13| Human 2: [that] _is_ [true] [i] [like] [food] _and the_ thought [of] [nutrition] as [you] [love] muffins
