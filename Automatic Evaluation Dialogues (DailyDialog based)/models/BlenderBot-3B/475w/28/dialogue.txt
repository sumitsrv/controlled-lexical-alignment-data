Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I just ate breakfast right before I went to the gym, I'm always hungry in the morning!
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!

Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I love the orange color. and Soylent would probably not turn your poop orange which would be a great drawback. 
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 That is true I like food and the thought of nutrition as you love muffins
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
