Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I've been thinking about this scenario for quite some time
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I feel like the person invited you because they were good for business not out of friendship but maybe they are now.
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's a good friendship, I hope they are for the right reasons not because of fear like mine!
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I hope you can avoid the issue all together, friendship takes sacrifice from everyone's sides
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 I hope the same too but it's always so easy for others to say they want to avoid conflicts. It's like that all the time.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm single because it's what they like and that's all the balance I need. But I always feel guilty.
