A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: [hi] 
A|2| Human 1: okay ... _so_ _i need_ someone _to_ help me though _a_ _scenario_ _i've been_ pondering . 
B|3| Human 2: [i've been] thinking about this [scenario] _for_ quite some time 
A|4| Human 1: my partner's former friend _invited_ me [for] lunch (they _are_ _not_ in _good_ books _right_ now) _. but_ during their _friendship_ _i_ formed an independent bond with _the_ other _person_ _because_ we _all_ used _to_ hang _out_ _a_ lot . _now_ _i feel like_ _i_ have _to_ take _sides_ . 
B|5| Human 2: [i feel like] [the] [person] [invited] you [because] _they_ were [good] [for] business [not] [out] of [friendship] [but] maybe _they_ [are] [now] . 
A|6| Human 1: _i hope they_ do . getting older already means smaller circles . it sucks _to_ lose friends [for] arbitrary _reasons_ . _that's_ [good] advice though . [i] _fear_ raising _the issue_ might sound [like] treason . lol . 
B|7| Human 2: [that's] [a] [good] [friendship] , [i hope they] [are] [for] [the] [right] [reasons] [not] [because] of [fear] [like] mine ! 
A|8| Human 1: aka avoiding _all_ texts _from_ everyone ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i hope] you can avoid [the issue] [all] together , [friendship] takes sacrifice [from] everyone's [sides] 
A|10| Human 1: people _always_ _say_ _to_ find [a] _balance_ [but] never _say_ _what_ _the balance_ is _. it's_ used _so_ often _that_ _it's_ vacuous . 
B|11| Human 2: [i hope] [the] same too [but] [it's] [always] [so] easy [for] others [to] [say] [they] want [to] avoid conflicts [. it's] [like] [that] [all] [the] time . 
A|12| Human 1: lol . _i'm_ finna be _single_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [single] [because] [it's] [what] [they] [like] and [that's] [all] [the balance] [i need] [. but] [i] [always] [feel] guilty .
