Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 It's been good. Just playing some video games the past few days
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 It's been good, thank you. You? What season is beach season? 
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 I went indoors and did the work that I need to do, beach season is pretty much coming up! It's sunny now,
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 I work near the beach that's a good idea! What kind of work did you need to do?
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 Well you have to be very careful in the water in some places like the Atlantic, never know whats in there!  It's dangerous to work
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 not dangerous at all, just some kind of work on the beach that i have to see when im down there
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure, but yes the psychological and physical factors such as fear have to be very challenging when mountain climbing
