Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking around and seeing what I could find.  You guys seem so much friendlier
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking to chat and talk about the weather, i am enjoying just looking out the window right now, it is beautiful
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 just enjoying the relaxing weather outside it's very good for your health but i love the cigar and it has a long history way before 1900
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 You must love the weather, it's nice for now but I actually just quit smoking haha
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 I would love it but the only way to enjoy is to be very careful not too haha. you could say its a once in a lifetime thing
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 I think it's more about reincarnation as what you believe it to be not just that your body will live on after death.
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 That would be nice but it will be harder when they find that brain death is inevitable.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
