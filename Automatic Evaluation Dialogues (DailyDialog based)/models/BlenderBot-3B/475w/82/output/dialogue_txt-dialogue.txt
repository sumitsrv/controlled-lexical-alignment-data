A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: yo ! _what_ brought _you_ here 
A|2| Human 1: _just looking to chat_ . yourself ? 
B|3| Human 2: [just looking] around and seeing _what i_ could find . _you_ guys seem so _much_ friendlier 
A|4| Human 1: _i am_ _just enjoying_ _a_ _cigar_ at _the_ moment . how _about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [just looking to chat] and talk [about] [the] weather , [i am] [enjoying] [just looking] out [the] window right now , _it_ _is_ beautiful 
A|6| Human 1: this one [is] _actually_ from peru , which [is] _more_ my taste . _smoking_ isn't _very_ healthy , _but_ _it's_ _actually_ quite _relaxing_ , which _in a_ _way_ [is] _good for your health_ . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: [just enjoying] [the] [relaxing] weather outside [it's] [very] [good for your health] [but] [i] love [the] [cigar] and _it_ has [a] long history [way] before 1900 
A|8| Human 1: _haha_ "you _only_ _live_ once" _as_ _they_ _say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: _you_ must love [the] weather , [it's] _nice_ [for] now [but] [i] [actually] [just] quit [smoking] [haha] 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , _that_ [is] _not_ [what i] was getting at , [but] yes _that would be nice_ . do _you believe_ _in_ _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [would] love _it_ [but] [the] [only] [way] [to] enjoy [is] [to] [be] [very] careful [not] too [haha] . [you] could [say] its [a] once [in a] lifetime thing 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] _think_ neural link _will_ allow [you] [to] _live_ _after death_ ? [i] thought [it] was [just] [a] brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [think] [it's] [more] [about] [reincarnation] [as] [what] [you believe] [it] [to] [be] [not] [just] [that] [your] body [will] [live] _on_ [after death] . 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] see . [that] [is] [a] [much] _harder_ task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: [that would be nice] [but] [it] [will] [be] [harder] when [they] find [that] _brain_ [death] [is] inevitable . 
A|16| Human 1: depends [on] how [good] [the] [brain] dump [is] [i] suppose ...
