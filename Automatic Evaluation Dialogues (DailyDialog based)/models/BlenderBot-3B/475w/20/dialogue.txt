Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 That's tough, Asian would be one of the first ones. What about you, what's next?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 Well I think Food would be one of the last things I would choose, love ice cream too much!
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 I would pick Chinese food and say the Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup. That stuff is heavenly. What about
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 I love ice cream!  My fav is vanilla and chocolate chip the most!  How about you?  Cream of Chicken is
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 Yeah chocolate ice cream is the best, and sorbet's and smoothies can be nice too if you like the variations
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 Chocolate and vanilla have the most experience in supernatural world's than any other flavor.
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
