Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 It's great I'm trying to learn more in a new language how about you
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I have made croissants once but they kind of flaked out. What are you trying to make them in?
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I'm good thanks.  It's been a great week but I have work to do for my new job tomorrow.  What are you trying to
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I'm trying to make cookies that have been baked but I've found out they turn out too sweet. I'll try and give them to
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I'm trying to make pastries but with a lot of the time that I think they are too sweet as well! But I haven't been trying
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I think I'm with you and all the sweet stuff too. The idea that people don't eat sweet baked goods to get away from sugar
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
