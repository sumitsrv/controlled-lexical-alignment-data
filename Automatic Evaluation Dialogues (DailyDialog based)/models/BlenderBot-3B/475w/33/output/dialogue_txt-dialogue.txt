A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ _once_ or twice so far , _but they_ _haven't been_ flakey enough . [i'm trying to] figure _out_ why _. what_ _kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ [you] _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [croissants] [once] [but they] [kind of] flaked [out] [. what] are [you] [trying [to] make] [them] in ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [good] [thanks .] [it's] [been] _a_ [great] week [but] _i_ [have] work [to] do for my new job tomorrow [. what] are [you] [trying to]

B|11| Human 2: [i'm trying [to] make] [pastries] [but] [with] [a] lot [of] [the time] [that] [i think] [they] are [too] [sweet] _as_ well [! but] [i] [haven't been] [trying] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] _stuff_ was when <redacted_term> was being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [i'm] [with] [you] [and] [all the] [sweet] [stuff] [too] . [the] [idea] [that] [people don't] [eat] [sweet] baked goods [to] [get away] from sugar 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
