Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I heard it was good. I saw The Last of the Mohicans, also from 1943. Ever see that one?
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 last weekend I saw The Last of the Mohicans and it was great, it has RDJ in it and the whole movie.
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 I did! Last weekend the Russo Bros and Steven Spielberg made the last Mandalorian movie. What an epic
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 Mandalorian has great reviews as well. What you did see last weekend, was the Marvel Cinematic Universe's The Last
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I think the only Mandalorian movies I've seen was the Star Wars and MotoCon lol. Spiderman is too
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I was looking forward to that one! I think the reviews were good and it has Tom Hardy, can't really go wrong with that.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 Spiderman was the name I've never heard before and Mandalorian is not good to watch. Ll
