Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, are you a girl?
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well!  Just cleaning my house, that's what I always do when it's dirty!
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I enjoy being outside but it's already too cold outside so I'm thinking about doing some work that I need to do inside
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 what do you like doing outside work? i love action movies that's cool but it's not all i enjoy it is just one
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I like action movies but not what happened there, I like doing it when I'm outside.
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 it will be like that but there's one time you get there and you sure remember the details and that's when you forget the whole movie! haha
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 I know, it's like that. I enjoy the details but not knowing what will happen next
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 Yeah that's the only real thing you want is not knowing what will happen. I didn't watch it till much later and it was awesome then.
Human 1:	 Thanks!
