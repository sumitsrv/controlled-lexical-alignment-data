Human 2:	 Hey, they are giving out goodies, I heard some are for a special event on my birthday but it may not be for many people.
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 Hi, its cold out here.  I guess they are giving out goodies for the Hurricane that hit us.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 Sure that the cold weather is for good and our health! Its even much needed to get outdoors to walk in some places
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 Where did you live that was hit by the hurricane?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live in the outskirts of New york but we're not that cold right now, it was nice for me to get a bit of
