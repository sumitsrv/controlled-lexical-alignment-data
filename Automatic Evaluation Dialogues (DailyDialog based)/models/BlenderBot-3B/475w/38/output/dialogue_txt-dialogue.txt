A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [like chat bots] , _i think_ _they are_ _a_ _great_ way _to_ help [you] [chat] online , _it_ allows [you] _the_ opportunity _to_ communicate _with_ people across 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have_ _made_ _some great progress_ _over_ _last few years ._ do [you] _think the positives outweigh the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i [think_ the positives outweigh the negatives] . 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it _sounds_ far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ [have] seen [some great progress] [made] [over] [the] [last few years .] _i think it_ _is_ [far fetched] _that_ someone invented [it] , [it sounds] [like] [it] 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some] of _these_ _bots are_ _very_ engaging _and_ funny . [they are] now _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how [far] [are] we _from_ [the] _time_ _these_ [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] don't [think the positives] outweighs [the] negativ [are] [and] [that] [sounds far fetched] too . [some] [bots] [even] [have] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think it] _can take_ many different forms as [a] product . [the] research implication [is] _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai research has progressed so [far] [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might _be_ overselling [it] _here_ 😛 
B|11| Human 2: self-driving cars [are] progressing [very] quickly [and] [will] [be] [here] in [the] not too futur , maybe in [a] [few years] [time] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ do _pretty_ _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [some] [bots are] [already] [good] [like] [the] ones [that] [can take] [over] [from] [you] [and] play [a] game for [you] , [also] [these] [are] not [even] programed by 
A|14| Human 1: haha , _pretty far fetched_ 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] [good] [and] [the] bad [will] [be] overcome [with] [time] , [i think] [you] [are] right [about] [that] . but [this] [is] [pretty far fetched] !
