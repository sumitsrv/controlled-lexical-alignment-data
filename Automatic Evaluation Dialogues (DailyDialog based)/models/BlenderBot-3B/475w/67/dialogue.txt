Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks, what are your hobbies?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm great! Seville is near Spain? I've never been there, but want to. I hear it's wonderful for skydiving
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 Yes I'm really scared, Have you done any sky diving before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I'm actually afraid of heights! Have you done any skydiving before?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I'm definitely trepidatious but you have to start somewhere, it's only for fun. Have you tried any sports before? Yes,
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I do. I'm very skiddish and the idea of falling down an endless slope that you can't escape from was too intense
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
