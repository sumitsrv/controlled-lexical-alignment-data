Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 Hello to you too, I met you the other day. It's a small world. You have a good night.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 Hey! It's totally possible, I don't have a lot of freinds so you would stand out. Did you dance with the group of people
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 I don't have schwasty perception but you sounded familiar when you said "Hi!". It was a really hot night there though
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 You met me! I'm the cardiologist from New York you have met!
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you are talking about. You are that doctor?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you mean.  You have heard the word butcher's block and that's a real job?
