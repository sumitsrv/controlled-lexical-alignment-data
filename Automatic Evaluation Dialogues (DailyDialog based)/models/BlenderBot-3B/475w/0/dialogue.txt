Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 My favorite is Christmas of course, even though I get presents at least one day, I get lots of people coming to meet me
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Wow, that is a lot! You must be one of the people who get lots of presents.
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 I think Australia is one of those places where you have to keep count.
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 I think it's really fascinating but sometimes people are kind of rude and forget what someone else is doing for them even if it's from their own
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 what are you talking about? where are people coming from?
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 That's what I mean. It is spooky to learn where people are coming from and what they have experienced
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 That's what I was thinking. Not often but I have before and it's interesting to see where they come from usually, you would think it's
