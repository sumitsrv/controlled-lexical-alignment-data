Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I watched The Avengers and it's one of my favorite movies
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 I have watched the movie but it's been a few years and that has not affected how i feel. Avatar was not good- I think
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I haven't actually, but that's interesting. Avatar the James Cameron movie with the blue people was beautiful, it's an example
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 I enjoy movies. what else you like to do beside watching movies
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 I enjoy baking and watching movies like that.   What have you been cooking lately? 
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 I like eating out and make some homemade noodle soup that way. What I have been watching lately is the movie Snow White
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 I like to bake and cook a lot. What type of soup?
