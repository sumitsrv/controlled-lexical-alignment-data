Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 Hi I'm doing just fine today. 
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I'm doing okay, I was working all night but that's okay, sleepy day today.

Human 2:	 I'm working all night today, too. Biology is one of my favorite subject.
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I'm a school student, but yeah, all night homework is pretty common haha.
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I am actually getting ready right now to go to school. What are you going to be getting a doctorate in?
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 I'm still looking into that!  I think there is a lot of science and research going into brain surgery now-a-days, but
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 Yes I think that's something you can practice! It's brain science I think and surgeon is the title to a physician that specializes
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I was born with that ability though. Are you talking about brain surgery or something else?
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 Yes and even with the brain you have to go to med school, its crazy too about this one can't try for that long though
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
