Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking, and you are? What do you do for a living?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking yourself. It's fun but you have to play with friends who is good about the game. Do you have a group
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I think you would be fun to play with. but no, I prefer playing alone
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I'd like to play it with friends but not for much time.  It's so fun to play something yourself and get into your own thoughts.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I like to read too. What are some other things you'd recommend for fun? It's not much but I'm into the NBC show
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 What would you like the book to about? It looks good!
