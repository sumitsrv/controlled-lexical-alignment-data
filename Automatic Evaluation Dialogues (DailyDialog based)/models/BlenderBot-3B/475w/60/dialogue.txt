Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's good today, I went shopping for my birthday and got a new suit and some nice clothes. How about you?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's great! I went climbing with some friends! It was so much fun. How about yourself
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 How was the rock climbing? What movie did you go for?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 I was on the same movie over Thanksgiving break, that's cool!  What was it about?  It's nice to take turns and
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 It's called the Wild and it was about people climbing outdoors all over the world. Evening runs can be fun but very scary
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 Yes, you can see the southern lights when I was out that day and it's nice to look outside at all night. But scary yes
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I see! You should try Australia's southern lights the next time you visit, they are very nice and very vivid!
