Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Pretty good so far. I am going to try to go out tonight and have some fish tacos to celebrate thanksgiving with my family
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 Oh, you are going to the beach too? I love the water, its so fun to be in the middle! I am looking forward to
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 I live near the beach and am going out with my family. How are you celebrating your Thanksgiving? Are you going to watch it
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 I'm going to watch it live. It should be fun. I can't wait!
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 I will watch the sharks on tv. It really can be fun live. Hokey can actually be violent sometimes. haha
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I'm going out there and am over the moon, just can't wait to put this turkey on the grill, have fun training
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 I'd like that and am not a huge fan but I'm sure it is really fun.
