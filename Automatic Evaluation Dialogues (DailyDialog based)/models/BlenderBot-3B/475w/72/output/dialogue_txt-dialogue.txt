A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't _reflect back_ _too_ _much_ _on things_ _, but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for me_ _in_ terms _of_ _time_ spent _with_ _family_ _and_ friends _and _work_ life _balance_ ._ _why_ do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [for me] [too] [, but] [things] [have been very] hectic [and] stressful [with] [work life balance] [and] [family] [time] _is_ really hard _to_ [balance .] _you ?_ 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! good _idea_ [to] _help people_ figuring _out_ _their new year_ resolutions 🙂 _so_ _how_ do _i_ _get_ a fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [great] [time] [to] [reflect back] [on things] [and work] [out] [how] [you] can [help people] [get] theirs resolved [too] [for] 2019 . 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! _sounds_ amazing if we _practice_ _that_ ! _i think_ [the] _idea_ does _have some_ potential . [how] did [you] come up [with] _this idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [you] [have] _to be_ more aware [that] [this] [too] shall pass . 
A|8| Human 1: thats [great] ! [this] [is] valuable [help] _for the_ community _. [i_ think] _mental health_ _is one_ _of_ [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [this idea] [is one] [that] [have been] _around_ [for the] last [year] [and] [some] years , since [people] [get] [this idea] [but] [with] [their new year] they will _be_ [health] 
A|10| Human 1: _that is_ _actually_ a _quote_ stolen from my tl when [i] joined my first _company_ after graduation _. i_ guess now after 5 yrs _of_ [work] experience , [i] fully _agree with_ _it_ 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: yes [that is] [very] _true_ . [that] [and] [the] [mental health] care [for the] disabled 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family] [and] friends play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring [around] [with] [new] _stuff_ 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] _busy_ ... _so_ [on] 🙂 [what] _about_ [you ?] [is] _there_ a _right_ answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [that] [quote] [about] [mental health] [and] [life] [in] general always makes [me] [think] [that] [the] [right] amount [of] [practice] [and work] [may] [help] [you] [with] [some] [stuff] [, but] [there] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's_ [very] thoughtful [and] _spiritual_ 🙂 also music earned a spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [so] [great] [that] [you] [agree with] [the] [company] [and] [their] [work] . [it] [sounds] like you're [very] [spiritual] ! 
A|16| Human 1: _i am_ _actually_ _not_ _much_ [of] a reader _. i_ _usually_ hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] [not] [how] [i think] [about] [life] [that] [much] [and] [that's] [why] [i think] [i] [may] [actually] [have some] [mental health] issues [. [i] am] [usually] [very] [busy]
