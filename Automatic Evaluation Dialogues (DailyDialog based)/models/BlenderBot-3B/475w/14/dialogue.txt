Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 that's sounds cool! and I am doing good, went to a park with my family today
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I am good and the park was that in coaster city, tx?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 wow that's cool I'm not a coaster kinda gal but I can understand the allure and adrenaline you must have felt.
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I'm not that much. It wasn't the tallest roller coaster but I rode the Kingda Ka.
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 I wasn't but now that's what I'm into hahaha
