B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ have _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [hi !] _i_ _like_ _them_ all . 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm working on_ _a_ _theory ._ why _does_ _the lotus_ _spring_ to mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm working on] [the lotus] _flower ._ my family [does] _it_ in our back yard every [spring] . 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! _just a_ personal _theory _._ _i_ think_ _that_ [flower] preferences _are more_ revealing _of_ personality _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] know [the lotus] _flower is_ important in [a] lot [of] cultures [. i] bet [you] [it's] [a] beautiful [theory .] 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ _. _it's_ like_ [a] cartoon [flower .] as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon _and_ then [it] came to life . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's like] [the lotus] [flower] _with [the_ gerbera] [and] dandelions [that] [are more] [than] [i think] [people] understand _, you_ can 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] [, you] ask someone _what_ their favourite [flower is] . pretty _much_ [like] _what_ we _just_ _did_ . [does] [that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] agree [with] [that] . [the lotus] [flower is] [a] beautiful [and] gorgeous plant [. it's] [much] [more] [than] [just a] decorative plant 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with _the] person_ some [more] , [and] ask [them] some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] _sense_ [of] _what_ they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two to five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: yes _that's_ [what] [the person] [did] [and] [you] [are] right [it] [does] [make sense] , [i think] [just] [like] they say [the] [more] [you] know , [it] doesn't 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
