Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Hi! I like them all.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I'm working on the lotus flower. My family does it in our back yard every spring.
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I know the lotus flower is important in a lot of cultures. I bet you it's a beautiful theory.
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 it's like the lotus flower with the gerbera and dandelions that are more than I think people understand, you can
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I agree with that. The lotus flower is a beautiful and gorgeous plant. It's much more than just a decorative plant
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 Yes that's what the person did and you are right it does make sense, I think just like they say The more you know, It doesn't
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
