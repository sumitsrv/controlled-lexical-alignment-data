Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Christmas would be the perfect time for that! Disneyland is one of my kids favorite places
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 I have heard the Christmas events and would love for them to join you!
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 We might be able to fit that in the schedule. Do you have kids?
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure about that! Maybe for the Christmas Tent in Disneyland. Good point! Maybe they can work something out and close out the
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I think we can, but that would mean not having work for the kids christmas morning, and they do not like that idea! They're so
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 No, not any time soon.  What are your kids going to think about this? 
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 They are going to have an exciting time for sure. I can't wait to take them out and get them something.
