Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. Deja Vu.
Human 1:	 what does that mean?
Human 2:	 that what?
Human 1:	 Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?
Human 2:	 I sometimes get that feeling just before the moment happens, does that mean anything to you?
Human 1:	 How do you know so much about this French phrase?
Human 2:	 i know that feeling, the phrase "déjà vu" means "exactly the same"
Human 1:	 yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.
Human 2:	 that's pretty much exactly what I mean
Human 1:	 wdym by word origins here?
Human 2:	 yeah that's pretty much the word origins, you must know a lot about french! 
Human 1:	 Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂
Human 2:	 I learned that today too.  I felt pretty dumb because I have this feeling about something that's going to happen again. Never thought about it before
Human 1:	 My friend used to tell me this and found it funny - Mosquitos have 47 teeths
