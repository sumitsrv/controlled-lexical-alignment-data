Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 I'm great! It's croissants time! It's how I make my living!
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I've been trying but you have to make them flakey enough to make it look done before they start out and once it's made they get
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I've been good thanks for asking. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I have made cookies that you make out of sweet potatoes. They're toothpick-shaped and they're so good.
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I don't think that I have a sweet tooth, but with all the people who say they eat them, you'd figure I would too.
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I think you could get away with that if the people don't eat them! The sweet stuffed m&M cookies and peanut butter
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
