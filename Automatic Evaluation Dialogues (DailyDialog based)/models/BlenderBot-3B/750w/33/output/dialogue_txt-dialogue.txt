A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done_ _them_ _once_ or twice _so_ far _, but_ _they_ haven't _been_ _flakey enough_ . [i'm] _trying_ _to_ _figure_ _out_ why _. what kind of cookies have you made ?_ 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [been] [trying] [but] _you have_ [to make] [them] [flakey enough] [to make] _it_ look [done] before [they] start [out] _and_ [once] [it's] [made] [they] _get_ 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] [good] [thanks] for asking [. what kind of cookies have you made ?] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is _a_ [good] idea . i'll give [it] _a_ try next [time] . _would_ [you] _say_ [you _have] a sweet tooth_ ?

A|10| Human 1: some _people don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , _i think_ i'd _eat_ pastries _all the_ [time] _if_ [i] _could get away with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think] [that] [i] [have a sweet tooth] [, but] [with] [all the] [people] who [say] [they] [eat] [them] , you'd [figure] [i] [would] [too] . 
A|12| Human 1: wow _! the_ last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [you] [could get away with] [that] [if] [the] [people don't] [eat] [them] [! the] [sweet] stuffed m&m [cookies] [and] peanut butter 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
