Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 No not yet, you?
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 No I did not eat lunch yet
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm having some for lunch and going vegetarian next month, its a good idea. Have you thought about it yet?
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I was having chicken and shrimp for lunch! I'm still going to eat fish though, but the place I ate at had some pretty healthy
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I love going for lunch and had some vegetarian sandwichs the other day. They are pretty filling. Have you tried them before? Where
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I had it for the first time this weekend and kind of love how you can have all different dishes prepared well depending on how foodies are going
