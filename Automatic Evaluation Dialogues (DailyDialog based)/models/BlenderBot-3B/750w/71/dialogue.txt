Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Bruhhh its going great.  Just got off of work.
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 Well it was the weekend. I'm sure you had a day off
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry for you. What was the project and was it shelved due to some unforeseen circumstance?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I've loved one who lost someone and that was some sad days for me, you can say that. Would you be angry at yourself for shelved
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I was working on some new work for you. I was sad, and angry that I lost your project. 
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I have lost and my wife was pretty sad about that project, how are you now?
