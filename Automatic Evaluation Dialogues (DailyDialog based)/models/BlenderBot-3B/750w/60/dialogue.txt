Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It is good, it's daytime
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was great. I went climbing as well. I was a bit scared the first day but ended up enjoying it very much. How about yourself
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was good!  I went rock climbing about the same time.  What movie were you watching?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 It was the movie that they had Thanksgiving Day weekend and that's when all the good stuff came out
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 It's the little that they have to go out and be all alone that makes it fun but scary...
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I like going out and being alone. it actually calms me the same when it is darker here. good question you are very smart
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 Australia too! I once was southern lights but very brief because it's the twilight here over night.
