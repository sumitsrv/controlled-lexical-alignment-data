Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 nice meeting you. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 Just meeting up with some friends to play some tennis later
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	 I craving a nice steak for dinner, what are you up to tonight?
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	 Ramen is the food you crave for only when you are so lazy that you are about to starve yourself. I know what you mean
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	 Yes and Ramen are the best food you cant beat them for a noodle dish. Mateo has only been here for 5 years
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	 Do you know Ramen Matsuyama near the San Mateo Baylor University and Berkeley Bowl campus?
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	 the best Ramen I have tried has been Parlor and Dojo.  when they are good they are better-than any ramen
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
