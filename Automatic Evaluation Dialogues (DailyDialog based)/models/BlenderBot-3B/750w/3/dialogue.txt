Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 I am afraid so. It raining pretty bad right now
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 They sure do make days gloomy. 
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Yeah this year is the rainy one. It is gloomy everyday where I'm at too because of that water that collects at the drain
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 They can make days gloomy that's true and they're the worst weather ever.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 Wheres the water supply there? 
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 the weather was pretty darn bad this morning but it did not rain that much
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
