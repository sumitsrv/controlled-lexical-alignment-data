A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally _don't_ reflect _back_ _too_ _much_ on _things_ , _but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for me_ _in_ terms _of_ _time_ spent _with_ _family_ _and_ _friends_ _and work_ _life_ _balance_ . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: just [life] [and work] [balance] [have been very] [much] [back] [and] forth [for me] [with] [too] long [but] [things] are looking _up_ _now_ 
A|4| Human 1: great ! _good_ _idea_ _to_ help _people_ figuring _out_ their new [year] resolutions 🙂 so _how_ do _i_ _get_ _a_ _fresher outlook_ ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [don't] [have] [much] [fresher outlook] [but] [things] [get] better [with] [time] [and] [you] learn [how] [to] manage [life] . 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if _we_ practice _that_ ! _i think_ [the] _idea_ does [have] some potential . [how] did [you] come [up] [with] _this idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: _that is_ [very] positive 
A|8| Human 1: _thats_ great ! [this] [is] _valuable_ help [for] [the] community . _i think_ _mental health_ [is] _one _of_ the_ bigger _challenges_ _facing_ humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [have been] through [the] [mental] [and] emotional [challenges] [you] are [facing] . [thats] [how] [i think] [this idea] came [out] [of the] subconscious ! 
A|10| Human 1: [that is] _actually_ _a_ _quote_ stolen _from_ _my_ tl _when_ [i] joined _my_ first company _after_ graduation . [i] guess [now] _after_ 5 yrs [of] [work] _experience_ , [i] fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [that] [quote] [actually] came [from] [the] [work] [of] [one of] [my] [friends] [when] he [and] his [family] was [facing] [mental health] [challenges] [after] he was [in] [a] [very] difficult 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family] [and] [friends] play [a] big role _here ._ 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring _around_ [with] new stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] busy ... so on 🙂 [what] _about_ [you] ? [is] _there_ [a] _right_ answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: it's [that] [life] [experience] [you] [get] [from] [the] [work] [and] [family] [you] [have] [right] ? _that's_ [valuable] . 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! [that's] [very] _thoughtful_ [and] spiritual 🙂 also music earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] interesting [and] [you] [may] [have] [a] [very] [good] point [there] [actually] , [that's] [a] [thoughtful] [one] [from] [this] [quote] . [what] would [you] [think] [about] [the] 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am [actually] _not_ [much] [of] [a] reader . [i] _usually_ hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that is] [very] [much] [the] case , [and] [that's] [not] [usually] [the] [thoughtful] [people] [we] [think] [about] [when] making quotes [around] [here .] whats [the] [quote] 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! it [may] turn [out] [to] be [a] best seller :)
