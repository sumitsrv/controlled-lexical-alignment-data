Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Nothing much, do you like to garden?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 Hello friend, how are you doing this evening?  Nothing much had fun last time, do you like the outdoors as much as I
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 Oh okay was you going to say how long it had been the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 It changed really recently actually. It's been a long time since I last seen this friend of mine. We had a lot of fun together back in
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 I do like going adventures but sometimes it is awkward for me to go to some places, but I am more confident the last time was last year
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 Ahh that is really cool for you but adventures sometimes can be time consuming, have you considered taking any recently?
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 Sure, it does look like fun but you have to wear your bullsuit for that I would think. What time did you last see your friend
