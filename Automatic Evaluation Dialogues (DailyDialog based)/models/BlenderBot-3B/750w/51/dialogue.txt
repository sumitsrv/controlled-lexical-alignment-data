Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's good. I went to the fair. I bought a horse. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 haha been about 6 hours with some friends actually, but had a great part time shift since then
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm great but going fishing with friends is a good time I usually like that. How long had it been since you partied before that?
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 It's been years but I always had fun with the horses haha. How about you got any plans for that fishing trip?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I'm going fishing today with some friends, its been over a year since we've done that last before. Have you ever had any cool sea
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I like going fishing the most with some good tuna though
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I have never been there but the city itself is great. What is your favorite place and why is Tokyo?
