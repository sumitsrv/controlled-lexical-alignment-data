Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty good! I am busy making the list of everyone who sent a gift! How are you?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I don't have any plans for the break that day, but I think I can make it work for the most part. You?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 I like to play the piano for fun. you?
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I like to run long distances for the fun of it too! Haha not any plans that you just have though huh?
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I just have work that evening, haha. I've not been sleeping well these last couple weeks though. And you?
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I like long distances when I have a good amount of time, but not when I've to get up so early tomorrow.
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I like running marathons just for the fun, not because I have any goals in this one.
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 It was one marathon for me this year - running long distances like that is tough - did you run the half as well?
