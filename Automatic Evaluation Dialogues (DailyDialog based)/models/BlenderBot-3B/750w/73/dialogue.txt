Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Good day, going to get some dinner. How about your's?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 its going good just ready for this game tonight I'm getting chills
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I'm getting ready, I have the day off of work tomorrow. No, I haven't seen them play but good luck!
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I see them play every year with the New York Grizzlies in the nba league but the team name is different. Have you seen them
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 Hahahaha I'd like the name The New York Chairs.I'm more of an animal lover naming them all these names with something
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 I'd love that name too, all the animal names confuse me! Sounds original to me. I'm guessing The Chairs is a play
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 Chairs is the name of that team from New York! The New York Grizzlies! I think it's cool that basketball is still
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Ahh very scary movie! The New York Chairs was actually the name of some cool chair that I saw about once-stopping this
