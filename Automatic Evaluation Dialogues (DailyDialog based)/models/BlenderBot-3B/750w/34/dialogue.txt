Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 Yes! I have a plan to buy my brother a nice Christmas gift! Do you have any plans this thanksgiving?
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 I have not decided yet.  Probably going to a pumpkin pie party with family for thanksgiving
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 Sounds great! I have the whole family with me for thanksgiving, it will be nice to not have to wait for my parents to get back
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for the pie to reach thanksgiving. Stuffing and other sides are usually with turkey. what
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 Stuffing and the christmas pie are some of my favorite for sure! I think you should buy the extra pumpkin then!
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	 I'm the opposite for christmas and thanksgiving you can have everything that has price tags
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
