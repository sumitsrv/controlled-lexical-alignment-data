Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 Just got this guitar for Christmas. I play mostly rock but I have started to try something new with electric guitars.
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 well the guitar took time still can't play chords for long though,  I want to be this way 
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 That's for you can't play them well at the time and are still learning guitar? I know chords are pretty much language like everything else.
