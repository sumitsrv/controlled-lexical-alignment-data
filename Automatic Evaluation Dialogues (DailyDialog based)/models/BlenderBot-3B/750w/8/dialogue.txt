Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 It has been great, your week is going good? I know that I'm getting close to a weekend now, cant wait to get out of work
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 Its been ok I got out of the game for all December too with the cold and flu and sickness you should rest your head
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'll have to with the cold too, this has been the most viral outbreak for the year so far
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I think the budget plans this year have been put on hold for me too. 
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 It's good you have it covered for the cold. I hope you love Hawaii but like most there are going to be some big plans this
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I have never been there before but I'll be sure to pack lots of lotion for the humidity. It's like you put it every
