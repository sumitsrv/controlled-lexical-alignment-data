Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I'm doing great today, and you?
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I'm sleepy today too. I was working all night.
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm okay! Biology was always my strongest subject. 
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I was actually high school haha. I'm glad you are ok though, are you gonna sleep?
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I was actually studying all night too. haha. I'm gonna be a surgeon, but I'm just working in a clinical lab
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 I think so? I just hope I don't sleep all of the day
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 I can, I think so haha
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I thought that too! But you have to practice with one of those things before you can do it on someone though.
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 Just a little too early for that haha, and I have this one friend with the same birthday as me so its hard to get him on med school
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
