Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking! How many skydiving lessons have you had?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking! Seville seems like an interesting town to go skydiving in.
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 I haven't done it before. I'm not really ready for the feeling of accelerating at high speed through the air for an extended period
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I'm feeling a little woozy myself.  Yes, I've tried extreme sports before. Have you ever done any skydiving?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I tried that once for my birthday, I'm definitely not ready but I think I'm getting better at it. Have you done any extreme sports before
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I tried once and was able to make the ski slope down the mountain but the rafting scared me. I'm very afraid of water for
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
