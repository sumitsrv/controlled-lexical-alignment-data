Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!
Human 1:	 Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?
Human 2:	 It was the longest travel breakup you could possibly have, and I took around for two years.
Human 1:	 Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?
Human 2:	 It was the longest break up and for a long time we were still good friends. Vietnam was amazing.
Human 1:	 Hehe! How long was the stay?
Human 2:	 It was long and hard because I couldn't take the time for him. He took me places and I still visit when I can.
Human 1:	  Great! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.reat! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.
Human 2:	 Yeah. He was the best and took care of me and still does.  How long you stay for Vietnam?
Human 1:	 Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts 🙂 I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing.
Human 2:	 Hehe, yeah. It was about the same for me and my ex. How long are you planning for next quarter?
Human 1:	 True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?
Human 2:	 Great time for you. He was back from the military and still doing some work?
Human 1:	 Okay. See tomorrow then.
Human 2:	 Hehe, yeah.  It was about the same time for you then, but tomorrow afternoon work for you?
