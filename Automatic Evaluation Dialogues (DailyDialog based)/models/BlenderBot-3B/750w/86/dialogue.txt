Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	 Do you? I have plans to buy the holidays for my kids. I want this year to be magical.
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	 Christmas is my kids favorite holiday and he will have a special family meal with just the 3 of you for it.
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	 I'm well, just home with the family and my daughter. Where will you holidays be this year?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	 I have been to Africa, the U.S., and Asia this year. Christmas with just my family will be special for me as well
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	 Where did you travel to Uganda or was it in Africa and Asia?
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	 Uganda was the safest African country for non-profit and volunteer work!
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	 I have volunteered in Uganda, It was all the time ago but it was for education and they called it an organization of humanit
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
