Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I just ate breakfast which always sets the day right for me, too! What did you have?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I had a brownie and coffee just like usual... which always sets the day right
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat food that's healthier than what I'm eating right now and you?
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I would eat my mother's apple muffins which are the only food that has always looked and tasted right to me.  So delicious!
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I love apple muffins, what's your favorite?
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I love muffins. That's the food that keeps me going through those days. What's your favorite food you like to eat
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
