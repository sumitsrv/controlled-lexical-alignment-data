Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland would be the perfect and fun Christmas trip for you then
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 you know the Christmas resort they have for Disneyland and the one in Orlando would be fun
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 Great idea! I will have to plan that for the kids then!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 that would work for sure and then you can drive around the resort in close proximity to Disneyland. have fun with the kids and
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 that would work for sure but the Christmas in the park was not close and closed down.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 Sure that would work for the kids. What time are you available this year?
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 I am getting him the legos that are about the same size and shape as this old christmas set they have of easter bunnies
