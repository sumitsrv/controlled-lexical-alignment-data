Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I've been pondering a scenario too, someone help me out here.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I used to have the friendship with someone like that as well. But they are not good person because I feel their partner was invited for other
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's not good, they are the issue now I hope you have a good friendship with the person
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I hope they take the advice from their friend's texts and invite you out with all of them! That would not help with the smaller friends
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 It's not like that but it was the right advice I always say because what are they for if they are never there for you when you need them
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm already single but the smaller friends from that friendship still text me often and invited me out for their parties. It's been nice.
