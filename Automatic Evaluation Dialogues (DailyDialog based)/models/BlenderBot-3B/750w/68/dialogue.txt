Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 Not much just you know some concepts

Human 2:	 I have some time now. But not right now unfortunately. How was the lecture last week?
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 Sure.  I have time right now
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 Sure that's the problem not preparation but rather time management. But how do you think your lectures have going for You. Anyways
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 True that. But the best preparation will help out with your time management, not only for tests but for the course itself. I think you
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 Thats the problem though, with course preparation I will get well prepared for this week, and have some time next week to relax
