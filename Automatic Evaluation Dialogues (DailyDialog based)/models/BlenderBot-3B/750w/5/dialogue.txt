Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad too. She's been gone about 2 weeks now
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 just great, catfood dish banging and shouting her name? how old is your cat? I've a cat too
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would go to disneyworld, where I've been going every vacation since I could remember and miss her. how about you
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to go there, the whole idea is just great. I'd love to see the cat and dog sized zipline from where
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I have a cat and would love to zipline wherever there are rainforests. I'm so scared about falling from a high distance
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I've never heard about one there.  That sounds like fun and scary.  It would make me want to just zip right on out of
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 you could make millions and zipline from anywhere, there isn't one at the rainforest resort I was thinking about, just an idea
