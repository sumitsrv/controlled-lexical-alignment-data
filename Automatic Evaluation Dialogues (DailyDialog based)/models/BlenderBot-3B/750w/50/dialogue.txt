Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 My day was very busy, but I am ready for it to end now, it's time to go home.
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 Yes actually, was doing the laundry for the weekend before we leave, you?
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 That sounds fun, and the weekend will just be spent on home for me. I plan that I am going to watch the game on Saturday and then
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 Europe sounds great for the weekend plans and you will get home just in time
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 It's great that you tried, you should keep at it and practice with your spanish homework
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
