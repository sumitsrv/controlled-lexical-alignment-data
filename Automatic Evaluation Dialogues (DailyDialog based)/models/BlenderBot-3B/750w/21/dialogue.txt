Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well. Just finished walking my dog. It is really hot out this time of year!
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well! I am really tired but that's why I took a nap. I gave up long ago cleaning emails too!
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I enjoy outside work but it's so hot that I'm not doing much besides cleaning
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I like movies that are action or science fiction but it's cool you enjoy outside work, what do you do?
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I work outside doing what's it is you like that keeps me active.. but never watched terminators movies
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 Yes you will it's a cool time but the end result is what's important to enjoy. I work for a cleaning company that only hires women
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 I like action movies the best, but not sure what to do in case this one turns violent haha.
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 haha that's cool you get the end result then. it is one of the best action movies but I am not sure what I want to watch this
Human 1:	 Thanks!
