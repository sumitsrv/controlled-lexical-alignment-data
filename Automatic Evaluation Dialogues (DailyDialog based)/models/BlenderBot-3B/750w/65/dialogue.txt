Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Well going pretty well! How about your's?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 so your moped broke down and you had to work the issue on it.  
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 that sucks! How broke down and why wasn't your mechanic supposed to work on it
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Okay that sounds good. He's the mechanic so we don't work on each others stuff. How you able to drive today? and is it fixed
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Okay the mechanic wasn't out today, so they said that should be fine, and the last time you came here with my car this has never been
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 no but i think so the game last night sounds good, i'll go check it out today and see the time you should drive here. they are
