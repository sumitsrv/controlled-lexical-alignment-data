Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 I have the same superpower you must be very proud of it.
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 Hi superman, my invisible superpower is the power to not get sick!
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 that would not be fun for me and for you,I trust fMRI more then the eye
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 It's pretty good for that you can tell the brain is working and not imaging fMRI. Being invisible would be awesome.
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 The brain can do amazing things and can see things you would not believe for sure.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 I believe that it can tell the brain's activity for sure. Science has been very important in our society and medical science
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I believe that the brain can tell us a lot about what's really going on and can make some good sense. The most important thing is the fact
