Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 How was the trip last weekend?
Human 2:	 I was the last kid at my friends house so she took me out to dinner.
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	 Nice you did what, last weekend? How was the trip?
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	 I actually did the washing up all weekend so all my clothes were clean. Hows your cooking classes going?
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	 I actually just started cooking zucchini lasagna the other week! it was super easy with all the sauce you have to cover them in
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	 Nice! for some reason the italian cooking classes are so much more easier. hope you enjoy it!
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	 That will be a pleasure and you will love it. Have you seen the cooking shows on any other cook offs. they can be pretty wild
