Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks. What do you like to eat the most breakfast?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I'm great and thanks! breakfasts are the most delicious thing, just had brown eggs and hash browns. What about you?
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat eggs and hash browns, forever! Breakfast food just always hits the spot that's true! What kind of breakfast meal
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I would want that orange and brown mudcake breakfast food
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I would love to eat hash browns forever. So true. That's the one food that's always in my fridge. I think you
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I like those too!  Yeah you could say that food is the most nutritionally complete and it's true. What would you choose?
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
