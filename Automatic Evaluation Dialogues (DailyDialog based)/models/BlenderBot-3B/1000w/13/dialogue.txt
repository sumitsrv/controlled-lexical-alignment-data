Human 2:	 The Mandalorian has great reviews and was the most profitable film last year.
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 I did see the Mandalorian last weekend - great action and big fan of Marvel.
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I'm actually the other way around haha Mandalorian was my least favorite Marvel movies and it made only 18 million lol
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I really like Marvel too and the other movies that was not Mandalorian were good also, did you think the new actor will bring
