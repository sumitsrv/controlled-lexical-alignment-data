B|3| Human 2: [i] [have been very] _busy_ [but] [time] [with family and friends] has [been] [spent] well [too] !

A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family and friends] play [a] big _role_ here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] _keep_ [you] [busy] ... so [on] 🙂 [what] about [you] ? is _there_ [a] right answer [to] [this] ? :)
