Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 I'm actually very well. How was your day?
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 Not for the weekend, I was doing some research that day though, you know to find out why so many people are having such trouble buying a house
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 Yes the day was busy and you are right for just having fun! I will stay home too but plan to visit Europe's capital
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 I will visit the Italian and Spanish cities for sure and plan on doing Europe's capital as well.
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 Sounds great, but you should know that Europe is the southeastern part of North America and spanish is the 2nd most spoken
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
