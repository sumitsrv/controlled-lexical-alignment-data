A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you think about_ human _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i think_ [chat bots] [like] angie's list _is_ _a_ _great_ site _to_ find _good_ prices _on_ items [you] _are_ searching for but _i_ hate 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed [to] _have_ made _some_ [great] progress _over_ last few years . do _you think_ _the positives_ outweigh _the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the positives] overweighs [the negatives] for me [like] [you think about] _it_ [some] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though [it] _sounds far fetched_ :) 
B|7| Human 2: yes [the] [sounds far fetched] . [what] [you think about] [it] ? 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] of _these _bots_ _are_ very engaging and funny_ _. _they_ are_ _now_ [good] at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how [far] [are] we _from_ [the] time _these bots_ start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they [are] very engaging and funny] that's [the] [good] part [about] them [you] [have] [to] admit 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] _can take_ many different forms as [a] product . _the research_ implication [is] also huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai _research has progressed_ so [far] [and] _better_ place [to] tackle _more_ _futuristic_ problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping [on] [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [that] [sounds] [like] [very] [good] [and] [futuristic] [research] ! [the] [more] [the] [better] [that] [will] [take] [over] our world . [what] [are] [these bots] [like] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions _already_ do _pretty_ [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [bots are] [already] [good] [and] [the [research] has progressed] _pretty far_ [from] [what] [i] [have] heard [. they] [can] [now] [even] differentiate between [more] generic [and] 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty [far] fetched] 🙂 nice _having_ this conversation _with you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the current] auto-supernatural [bots are] [like] [having] your [very] own supernatural friend [that] [you] [can take] [with you] [and] [even] imp
