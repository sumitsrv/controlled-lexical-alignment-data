B|3| Human 2: [i'm great] _but_ [going] _to_ have _a_ [day] off tomorrow and _i_ need _to_ do _some_ _work_ before [going] _to_ _a_ restaurant _i_ really don't want _to_ go 
A|4| Human 1: oh _that_ is _cool_ ! _what class_ ? [are you] _working part time_ ?

A|6| Human 1: oh _that_ is awesome ! [for] [some] reason [i] assumed it _was_ [a] _college class_ [, but] [a] _sewing_ [class] _sounds_ _way_ _better_ _! i_ [work] [full time] [, but] _i take_ _pottery _classes_ from_ [time to] [time] ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [working part time] [but] [full time] [college class] [was] [better] than [classes from] [work] that's why [i take] [some] daytime and after [work] ones [to] relax 
A|8| Human 1: [i] feel [you] on _that_ _! it's_ important [to] balance _all the_ _different_ parts _of_ _your_ brain . [i] _like pottery_ because [i] _also_ drink [a] lot _of_ _tea_ , _so_ [i] _get_ _to _make_ some_ _tea ware_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [i take] [the] [classes] [that] [get] me [all the] [way] through [like pottery] [but] [also] [make some] [cool] stuff with woven fabric [like] pillows 
A|10| Human 1: _i would_ _love_ [to] build _one_ , once [i] acquire [the] _skills_ [to] ! _what kind of_ _tea_ is _your_ _favorite_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [what kind of] [pottery classes] do [you] [take] _? i_ [love] [the] arts [but] [sewing] [would] be [great] [also] [! it's] [one] [of] my [favorite] [skills] 
A|12| Human 1: _ahh_ , _those_ [are] mostly [from] japan , no [? i] [like] white _teas_ , [like] silver needle . 
B|13| Human 2: [ahh] [that] [sounds] _like a_ lovely [way] [to] [get] [those] [skills] [you] need [to make] [the] [tea ware] [your] own [! [i] would] [also] [like] [one] ! 
A|14| Human 1: [i] actually found [a] youtube channel called <redacted_term> [that] [i] [like a] lot . [you] should check it _out_ ! [the] host talks about [all] kinds [of] _different_ _teas_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [love] [that] [tea] [also] , [all] [those] [different] [pottery] and japanes [teas] [are] [so] [cool] [from] [the] [way] [you] [make] them [out] [of] clay
