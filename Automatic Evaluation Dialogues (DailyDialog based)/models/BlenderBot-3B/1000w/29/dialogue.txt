Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I'm great but going to have a day off tomorrow and I need to do some work before going to a restaurant I really don't want to go
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I'm working part time to save for college, but going to school full time for psychology. What class you have off tomorrow?
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I'm working part time but full time college class was better than classes from work that's why I take some daytime and after work ones to relax
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 I take the classes that get me all the way through like pottery but also make some cool stuff with woven fabric like pillows
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 What kind of pottery classes do you take? I love the arts but sewing would be great also! It's one of my favorite skills
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 Ahh that sounds like a lovely way to get those skills you need to make the tea ware your own! I would also like one!
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 I love that tea also, all those different pottery and japanes teas are so cool from the way you make them out of clay
