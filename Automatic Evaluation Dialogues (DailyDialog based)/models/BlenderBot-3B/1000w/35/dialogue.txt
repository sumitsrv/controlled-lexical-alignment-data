Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I'm sleepy too! I slept too late today and then got hit with a sudden bout of insomnia. Do you
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I was working all night and sleepy all day today. 
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm sleepy yeah but doc you are all someday gonna be Biology? That's cool I was in the science field
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I'm actually a school teacher now haha.  I was in high school when I was studying it.  My son just got accepted to Uni
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I was a high school teacher haha and actually my mom wanted me to be a surgeon so she always begged me to go to medical school and
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 That's so cool. I'm not sure if I wanna surgeon or not, haha.
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 Yeah you can actually practice surgeon that way.  It was something I was thinking too but now I feel it's not for me.
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I was born with that talent. But, you have to try something if you wanna be good at it lol
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 Not too early for that thought and the schooling is even tougher. Maybe one day though. I have little confidence with the thinking part.
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
