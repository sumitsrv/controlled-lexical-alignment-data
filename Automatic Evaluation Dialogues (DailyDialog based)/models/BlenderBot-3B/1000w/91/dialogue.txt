Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	 Hello, I been good
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	 I'm going through the morning right now too.
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	 I'm going through the day off work and have been relaxing for time. How has your week going?
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	 I've been going for the most part and have had a lot of success, even acupuncture has always helped my asthma.
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 I've been going for the last week and have felt better than I did for most of that time! The literature was peer reviewed
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	 I'm the same way unless you have peer reviewed paper and even then that has to be from a recognized medical organization
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	 I don't think you can say it's not peer reviewed but the comic was written by Vito and is a lot like acup
