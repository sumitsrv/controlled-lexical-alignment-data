Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 Hey superman. What you doin tonight?
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 You won't see me either. I'm hiding in the shadows, superman style. What about you?
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 You trust machine learning for that and not a trained doctor? 
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 Yes I trust fMRI and that's pretty much why this is so scary for me. You can't see the brain activity you're looking
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 Sorry for that? You believe in god?
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 Science can help you understand the brain and I believe that it's what this technology is for, to learn about it better.
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I don't believe that this would make sense for the society. The brain can be a complicated thing and what you see there seems to depend on what
