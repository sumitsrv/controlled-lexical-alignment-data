Human 1:	 we've been doing Games of Thrones lately. the game takes a very long time to finish though!
Human 2:	 I'm doing the same thing! Games of Thrones will always keep you on the edge of your seat and eating food always makes it better
Human 1:	 I do. I'm a super fan of it (not the last season though haha). did you watch?
Human 2:	 I'm not the biggest fan of game of thrones. haha are you doing Games of Thrones season this year though?
Human 1:	 I love Survivor 🙂
Human 2:	 I love GOT. the last season was very good. It was not as good though.
Human 1:	 nice! I mostly like comedy shows like The Good Place and Modern Family
Human 2:	 I am not. The last season was the worst and my shows are like supernatural.
