Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 It rained pretty bad today, so I was pretty much in a mud pit

Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Well the rain is pretty bad today. I don't like them too much either. They make all the water that had just rinsing away from
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 Haha the weather can make days like that pretty gloomy. Where do you think you grew up?
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
