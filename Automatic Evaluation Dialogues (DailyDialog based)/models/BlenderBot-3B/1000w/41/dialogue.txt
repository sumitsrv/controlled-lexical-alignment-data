Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 Do you know people whose lives suck due to their faith?
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 It's too easy to say well there are many who can't have faith in miracles, but you know there's people that believe in them
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 well, I wouldn't say there's too many people out there who believe because the process can get hard and not much good comes out of them.
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 It's not about the miracles or people who can't have them.  You just need good vibes and know you are important. 
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 You have a good outlook on things too many people get depressed and lash out because there's not much you can do to change the world.
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 I grew in the south with people who have not much and you got what you get
