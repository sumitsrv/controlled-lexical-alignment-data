B|1| Human 2: do _you_ _believe in miracles_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: lol . no . _i_ _know_ _too many _people_ whose lives suck_ . 
B|3| Human 2: do _you_ [know] [people whose lives suck] due _to_ _their_ faith ? 
A|4| Human 1: _it's _too_ many_ _of them_ _out there_ _. you_ help _who_ _you can_ . regardless _, i wouldn't say_ _i_ [believe in miracles] - _well ,_ if _i_ _got_ promoted next cycle _i_ might _change_ my mind . 
B|5| Human 2: [it's too] easy _to_ [say] [well] [there] are [many] [who] can't _have_ faith [in miracles] , but [you] [know] there's [people] that [believe in] [them] 
A|6| Human 1: right now , _not much_ . [it's] unclear . career is _a good_ fallback _because_ _you get_ told _what_ _good_ means _and you_ act accordingly . _i_ haven't gone through _the process_ _of_ shaping my values . _what_ _about_ [you] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [well [,] i wouldn't say] there's [too many people] [out there] [who] [believe] [because] [the process] [can] [get] hard [and] [not much] [good] comes [out] [of them] . 
A|8| Human 1: we didn't [have] electricity growing up . explains _a_ lot . lol . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's] [not] [about] [the] [miracles] _or_ _people who_ can't [have] [them] [. you] just need [good] vibes [and] [know] [you] are important . 
A|10| Human 1: it makes it easier [to] empathise _with people who_ _grew_ up lacking _things_ . [not] sure it makes me empathise _with people_ [in] general . where did [you] grow up ? 
B|11| Human 2: [you] [have] [a good] outlook on [things] [too many people] [get] depressed [and] lash [out] [because] there's [not much] [you can] do [to] [change] [the] world . 
A|12| Human 1: all [their] money ? by [a] person [or] an organisation ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [grew] [in] [the] south [with people who] [have] [not much] [and you] [got] [what] [you get]
