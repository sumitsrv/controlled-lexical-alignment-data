Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 No yet. The power was out where I am at. Have you had lunch today yet
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 I did!  and it's delicious. It had french bread with lettuce, tomato, and onions.
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm going for some shrimp and fish! what you having?
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I'm having some leftovers the pork and chicken was good for lunch though.
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I'm having some chicken and shrimp sandwich for lunch love them both though. Have you tried the buffet style before? They are different
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I love buffet style food because you can't eat it all and have the taste for too long though. What kind was it?
