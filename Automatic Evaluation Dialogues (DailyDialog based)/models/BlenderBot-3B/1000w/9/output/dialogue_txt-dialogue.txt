B|3| Human 2: hey [thanks for asking . how has your day been ?] _i just_ ate , _and_ _it_ felt so _good_ . 
A|4| Human 1: _glad_ _to_ hear _you're better_ . sorry _to_ hear _you_ were _sick_ . [i] _was_ _sick_ _a_ couple of weeks ago _with a bad cough_ . there's definitely _a_ bug [going] around . admit [i just] _want_ _to_ stay _healthy_ [for] _the _holidays_ and_ _plan_ _to_ relax . 
B|5| Human 2: _that's_ [the] [plan] [for] [you] [and] [your] [healthy] wellness . [glad] [you're better] ! [how] [was] [the holidays] [with] grandma ? _i hope you_ 
A|6| Human 1: definitely ! _i know_ _a_ lot of folks travel [for] [the holidays] _, but_ _i'm_ happy _to_ stay home _myself_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [the] [plan] [for] [holidays and] relaxing [myself] [but] [was] [just] [sick] yesterday [with a bad cough] [and] [you] [know] what's [the] worse _is_ 
A|8| Human 1: _me_ _too_ . now [i] _have_ folks come visit _me_ [for] [the holidays] ! [but] [that's] also _tiresome_ .. 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [glad] [you're better] [too] [but] [the holidays] [with] [your] family sound lovely [and] relaxing . _my_ family _is_ [just] [me] , [myself] , 
A|10| Human 1: _yes_ ! we set up an eco-friendly (i . e . fake) _christmas_ tree [and] put up _some_ colorful led _lights_ _which_ [is] _very_ festive . 
B|11| Human 2: [i know] [the holidays] _can_ be [very] [tiresome] [and] [that's] why [you] [have] [to] take [some] time [for] yourself [too] ! [yes] [but] at least 
A|12| Human 1: _buying_ [a] tree [is] [a] neat experience . [i] [was] _torn between_ _buying_ an artificial/eco-friendly/fake _one_ vs . [a] _real_ _one_ _that_ smells like fresh pine . in [the] end , we opted [for] [the] _one_ _that_ we [can] disassemble _every year_ . 
B|13| Human 2: [i know] [the holidays] [can] [have] [that] [torn between] festivity [and] health [which] [one] _do_ [you] [want] ? [buying] fake [lights] [was] [very] 
A|14| Human 1: [oh] , [very] clever pun ! [i] like [it] ! depends . _i remember_ _having_ _real_ _christmas_ _trees_ _from_ childhood _, but_ _these days_ [with] climate change , _i think_ _not_ chopping down [a] tree [just] [to] _decorate_ [it] [and] _then_ throw [it] _out_ in [a] _month_ [is] [the] _more_ responsible _thing_ [to] [do] . 
B|15| Human 2: [i think] [that] [was] [the] [very] [thing] [that] [i remember] [and] [not] [having] [christmas] [with] [out] [for] almost 2 [month] [, but] [then] [decorate] [every year] [myself] [from] 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store [is] target , plus _they_ _often_ [have] _good deals_ . 
B|17| Human 2: [i think] [that] [was] [the] smart choice [, but] [they] [have] [very] [good deals] [out] [and] fake [trees] are [often] [more] affordable than [real] tree's [these days] 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i hope you] find [a] nice tree .
