Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. Deja Vu.
Human 1:	 what does that mean?
Human 2:	 what does it mean that you have experienced something before?
Human 1:	 Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?
Human 2:	 Deja Vu feels sometimes that the future just happens but it does not mean the event that just played out already happened.
Human 1:	 How do you know so much about this French phrase?
Human 2:	 The phrase itself just means about the same thing that you just said. Interestingly enough this feeling was also referred to as the Echo effect.
Human 1:	 yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.
Human 2:	 Interesting that you thought about this before.  What's the etcetera effect?
Human 1:	 wdym by word origins here?
Human 2:	 I know a little about the etcetera effect because of this word origins.
Human 1:	 Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂
Human 2:	 It's interesting that word origins mean the concepts that you learned today are related to this conversation, right??? 
Human 1:	 My friend used to tell me this and found it funny - Mosquitos have 47 teeths
