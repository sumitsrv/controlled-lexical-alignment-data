Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 Hmm, Stirfry's seem to be one food you would think about eating forever! It is my favorite comfort food.
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 That would be ice cream too. Stirfry's are one of those Asian meals you think about all the time. What is your favorite
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 Mint chocolate chip would be the one and only ice cream I will eat, it's more about you?
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 Mint chocolate chip and vanilla ice cream are my top two favorite too. How about you?
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 I love vanilla ice cream and more than chocolate and strawberry. I like the smoothies too but the chocolate sauce makes it for me
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 What's something you love most about the physical world more than the afterlife? 
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
