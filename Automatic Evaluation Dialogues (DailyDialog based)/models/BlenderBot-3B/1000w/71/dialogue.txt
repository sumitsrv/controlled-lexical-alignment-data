Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Hey! Going quite well so far
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 Pretty good day so far, I was just walking the dog
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry for that. Are you working and having some day or project shelved? It was helpless
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry that you lost someone and I hope one day you recover. I've been working on some shelved project for months with similar emotions
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I was working for some months and going through some tough times. I was sad that day.
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I'm pretty lost and helpless but you are pulling your leg a bit trying to tempt me for that's right Lol
