Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Good afternoon, been busy working week has been great How are you doing
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I'm doing well for the week. I am sick with cold too. We been getting all the outbreaks.
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'm sick too, the cold has been with me all week.  I think it's partly from home
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I'm not even sick! I have been out of the game for too long!
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I like there but it's too humid for me, have you been? It rains a lot!
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I would love it there. It's a place like the beaches, all you have to do is put lotion on for the weather, lol
