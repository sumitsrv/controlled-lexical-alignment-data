Human 2:	 ziplining is a unique experience have you been before?
Human 1:	 i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though
Human 2:	 was it a ziplining activity where you rode a lift or something similar to zipline or a sled?
Human 1:	 that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you
Human 2:	 Nope that's it i'm going to have this weekend and see where we end up!
Human 1:	 no, i'm going to get a massage first
Human 2:	 No i have never been, that's quite exciting though you should get your massage first and see where it takes you.
Human 1:	 traditional kind
Human 2:	 I was going to get my first massage! I have been kind of hesitating because it's hard to get one from a traditional mas
Human 1:	 you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!
Human 2:	 Oh it's going to be an experience for sure.  I don't get massage often and it's hard to relax after long day at work
