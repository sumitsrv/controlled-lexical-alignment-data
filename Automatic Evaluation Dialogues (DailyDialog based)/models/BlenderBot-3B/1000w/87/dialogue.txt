Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm great, doing my morning routine of going to the gym. Do you workout regularly?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book "The southern are you looking over ocean"
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book, like how are you doing have fun looking over the ocean that seems great what about you?
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I like books that are more fiction but have lots of good tips, how does the book read to you?
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I like that book and it's about startups in Silicon Valley but for some reason the title reads better to me as Z
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 the book read well and it seems like you have good taste in books. that's for reading but also being a contrarian
Human 1:	 yup!
