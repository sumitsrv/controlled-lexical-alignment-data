Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 I like the one where people get together to eat lots of different foods
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Maybe people counting different kinds of food?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia was pretty cool, they think the place will be uninhabitable in a couple of years and they even make it sound like the place
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 The one where people meet and interact in a different culture?
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 The people are from different areas and cultures but you get it.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 That's what people always spooky me out, and I was surprised to learn it is where most of the human population lives but I don't
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 Not often but it's what I do when I'm on holiday.
