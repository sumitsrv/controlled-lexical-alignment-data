A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm_ _trying_ _to_ learn _how_ _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [it's great] [how] did _i_ [make] _out_ _with_ [croissants] ? 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ _once_ _or_ twice so far _, _but_ they_ haven't been _flakey enough_ . _i'm_ _trying_ _to figure out_ why . what _kind of_ cookies _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [made] [croissants] [once] [but they] ended up [flakey enough] [to make] [you] gag . [it's] [kind of] _a_ pain [to figure out] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thanks] , [trying] [out] [croissants] _was_ _a good idea_ [how] did [they] turn [out] ? 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ _is_ [a good idea] . i'll give _it_ [a] _try_ next _time_ . would [you] say [you] _have_ [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [made] [them] [to] [try] [out] _the_ [idea] [but they] didn't turn [out] [that] [great] . [it's] [kind of] [time] consuming _too ,_ [it] takes hours [to] 
A|10| Human 1: some _people_ _don't_ ! [but] yeah , _me_ [too ,] [i] _think_ i'd _eat_ _pastries_ _all_ [the] [time] if [i] could get away [with] [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think] [that] [they] [all] [have] [to] be [flakey] [, but] [the] [people] [eat] [them] [with] [a] croissant stick [or] [a] pastry 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff [was] when <redacted_term> [was] being marketed as [a] _fat_ substitute _, and_ caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [don't] [think] [sweet tooth] [is] [the] right phrase for [me] [, and] [pastries] [don't] [have] [to] [all] be [flakey] . [the] [fat] [that] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
