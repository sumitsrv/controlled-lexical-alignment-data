A|4| Human 1: [i] am [just] enjoying a cigar _at the_ moment . how _about_ yourself ? 
B|5| Human 2: [just looking] [at the] weather , [about] [to] go home 
A|6| Human 1: this _one_ _is_ _actually_ [from] peru , _which is_ _more_ [my] taste . smoking _isn't very healthy_ , _but_ it's _actually_ quite _relaxing_ , _which_ in a way _is good_ _for your health_ . _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: peru's [one] of [the] [more] [relaxing] places [to chat] [but] _it_ [isn't very healthy] [for your health] [which [is] good] [actually] [haha] 
A|8| Human 1: [haha] "you only _live_ once" as _they say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: [haha] [good] [one] 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , _that_ [is] _not_ [what] [i] was getting [at] , [but] yes _that _would be_ nice_ . do [you] _believe_ in reincarnation ? 
B|11| Human 2: that's [what] [they say] [but] [not] [for] me [haha] _it_ [would be nice] _to live_ once [more]
