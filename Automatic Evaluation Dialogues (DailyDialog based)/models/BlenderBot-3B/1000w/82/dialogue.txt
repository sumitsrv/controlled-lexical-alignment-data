Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking up some tips I can use for my upcoming trip to Florida. I think it'll be interesting chatting with people from around the country
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 just looking at the weather, about to go home
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 Peru's one of the more relaxing places to chat but it isn't very healthy for your health which is good actually haha
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 haha good one
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 that's what they say but not for me haha it would be nice to live once more
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 Neural interface would just allow that you can think what's going on not live your previous one
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 That would be awesome but it will be very much harder for me to believe that it will live up to what they say.
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
