Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I've been pondering the same scenario!
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I have the same issue with someone for now. But they like other person are not good friend material because they take all the invited and their partner
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's good that they are not invited for lunch because I feel the issue with friendship might arise in the future. But it sounds like
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 That's good that you all have the bond though! I feel like everyone has their reasons for not inviting other friends
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 That's what I hope. It means that they like the other person but it might not always work out with all their partner. But it never hurts
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I never used to like the balance but what's good for all is that it now always means everyone will have someone they love to hang out with.
