A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! my _favourite flower is_ _the_ cactus _. i_ [have] one in my garden . they come _with a_ spiky stem ! 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on [a] theory . why _does_ _the lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [lotus] blossoms [the] small [flower] _that_ [you] use in pottery _and_ they _are_ _so_ _pretty_ ! 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ [a] personal theory [. _i] think_ [that] [flower] preferences [are] _more_ revealing _of_ personality _than_ _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ [more] [than] likely [the] case . [the lotus] [flower] _it_ [not] only [have a] beautiful color but [the] texture also . 
A|8| Human 1: _the gerbera_ . _it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon _flower ._ as if [you] drew "flower" [with a] crayon [and] then [it] came _to_ life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [like] [that] [it's] gerbed [and] [you] can [have] many colors [with] [that] one [flower .] [it] [does] [not] need [to] be dug up each 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] _ask_ someone _what_ _their_ [favourite flower is] . [pretty] much [like] _what_ we _just_ _did_ . [does] _that make sense_ [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [just] love [flower] [it's] [gerbera] [like] [you] [that make sense] [to] me [and] [what] [people] [think] [of] when they [think] [of] [lotus] blo 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some [more] , [and] _ask them_ some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [what] [did] [you] [just] [ask them] [their] favorite [flower] [and] they answer [the gerbera] [lotus] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
