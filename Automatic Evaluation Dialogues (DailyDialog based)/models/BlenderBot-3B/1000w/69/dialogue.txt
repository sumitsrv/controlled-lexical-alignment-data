Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	 It was great! We got a party bus last week and cruised around town. How about your's?
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 I was really nervous at first, but you know as much as I like Turkey it really helped relax me! How about your party last week?
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	 haha last week was so funny! Haha you can't ever have enough party food! How was the bus ride?
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 Haha did you cook it from home? I thought it was funny that we ate Turkey last week, like a big family haha
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 Yeah it was from home but not like big party with the turkey haha. But you are always happy when your family got together. 
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 Did you have any turkey cook off with the party?  Also did anyone find our your chicken was not like Thanksgiving from home?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 Oh that was fun and the turkey always turns out great. It got cooked at our family party, with family and friends helping me put together
