Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking! What soccer game do you guys have in mind?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm great, thanks for asking! What soccer game do you play with friends? It's fun but I think I'm best playing by myself
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I'm thinking about getting soccer for my kids but am not sure. They play with friends in school but I think some other game would be fun
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I like soccer but not great at it! Switch would be fun for kids, you could play anything with them like Mario Kart and stuff
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I like the Switch for fun too but there are not much gamea you could play with it except Odyssey and Mario Kart
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 I like the book Temeraire!  What are you thinking about getting for them?
