Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 good day. just got done putting my kids down, and taking the garbage out. How about your's?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was good. I went rock climbing the other day and it's great exercise and can be a bit scary but I was okay I think.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was the movie The darkness about a girl who goes back in time and finds a nice guy.
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 Hahah that movie was great, yes the darkness and all the same people can make me very uncomfortable
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 Yes it can be scary and good exercise but the movie was very dark they all look the same! I'm not a fan of that genre
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I can see that it was fun you are very nice and good at the movie questioning thing like that's not been seen often here but yes when
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I like the winter too. But Aus can be scary when it's dark out. You should try going camping and see for you self.
