Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 going good day, I am on your favorite tv series tonight. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 Good morning and good day! How's the shop going this morn? How broke down?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 The shop broke down, now the mechanic can't figure out what's going on so I am trying to figure that out and getting frustrated
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 good day today and that sounds so awful. you don't have the time now to work on your moped
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Yes that sounds good. That should be fine they're not so busy today. I think the shop work and this is all you need btw
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Yeah the game was great I love their good basketball but I don't think they should win the championship this year
