Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 What game you playing, and just great so far
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I'm still taking credit for that pingpong game but you won very rarely?
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I'm well thank you for asking. I just won a game of pingpong. It's very exciting but that still doesn't mean your
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I like racquetball that's about it, you won very rarely but still taking credit for it
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I'm a cage player. It's like pingpong with you hitting the ball with the racquet with your hands.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 What kind of physical sport involves a cage and your being it with your hands though. I think that's sounds fun really
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
