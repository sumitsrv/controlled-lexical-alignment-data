Human 2:	 It's going well! Got the weekend off work, so I'm looking forward to being lazy. How are you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 Hey! I live the weekends for sure! Haha I watch everything live. Are you going to have a good day?
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Are you going to the sharks game this weekend? 
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 Hokey really can be violent haha I'll have the weekend off too this will be my first UFC live event.
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I am going and really can't wait, but there's over a year of training ahead of us just the jiu jitsu
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah I am but not really looking forward to it, and its just the weekend after that will be pretty fun.
