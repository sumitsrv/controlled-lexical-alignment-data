Human 2:	 Yeah, but you better know french before coming, and that's cool, we have been skiing most of the time and have the best
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 I didn't know any french but the skiing was fun and I got a great deal, only $15 for a day pass.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I know french! And my high school skiing team always used to compete in the Olympics. Did you ski? 
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I can't say that I've made myself the skiing was just a quick stop, but I wanted to see all of the cool things you
