B|1| Human 2: hello there , how is _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: pretty _great_ . _i_ _just_ _won_ _a_ _pingpong game_ . _what_ _about you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [what] is [pingpong _game] ?_ 
A|4| Human 1: no , _very_ rarely _. it's_ kind of amazing _that i won_ , _but_ _i'm still taking credit for_ [it] . 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm still taking credit for] the [pingpong] [that i won] [but] [you] know [it's] [just] one [game] ! [what] else [about you] today ? 
A|6| Human 1: haha thank [you] , [i] guess [i'm] [just] _a_ natural . what's _your favourite [game_ ?] 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [very] well [. it's] [just] [that] [you] said [your favourite game] was [pingpong] [but] there's also tabletennis _and_ [a] few 
A|8| Human 1: what's racquetball _like_ ? from context clues , _i'm guessing_ [that] _it involves hitting a ball _with a_ racquet_ 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] not [that] [great] [with] [it] [but] [it's] [very] _fun_ _to_ play . [it involves hitting a ball with a] paddle _and_ using [your] racqu 
A|10| Human 1: wow ! [a] _cage match_ ! does [it] _get_ _physical_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm guessing] that's [a] [game] [you] play . [you] [get] the [ball] in the net [with a racquet] [like] [a] _tennis_ racket 
A|12| Human 1: [that] _sounds_ [fun] . _i think_ of [tennis] itself as _being_ _really_ athletic [and] tiring , so [i] don't _think_ [it's] [a] sport [for] me , though ! 
B|13| Human 2: [it] is [physical] [and] [fun] [but] [i think] [cage match] [sounds] [like] [it] would [get] [really] violent [for] [being] played [just] [with [a] ball] 
A|14| Human 1: [what] [a] good idea , i'd love [to] !
