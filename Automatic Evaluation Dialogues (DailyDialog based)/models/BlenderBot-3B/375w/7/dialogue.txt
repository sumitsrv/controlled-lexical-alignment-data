Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I saw Avatar, but I can't remember what it's called. Was it the James Cameron version?
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 it's the movie with dances with wolves but that does sound interesting
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 No that's the movie Avatar but it is one of my favorites you have good movies to

Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 I like noodle soup with some beef and peas. What about you? What movie was it that you saw?
