Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 That one where I get the best gifts.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Maybe you get 25 presents.
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia! I love that place where everything wants to kill you.
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 I really love it when people are trying to get to know me and what kind of things we like or where we are from.
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 The people are so nice and you get what I mean, but it's like they have really short lifespans.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 Oh really? That's interesting and I think you are probably right! The people from the southern hemisphere are much spookier
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 I do, but I was never very good at it! That's usually why I like to do it with people from my childhood who are still
