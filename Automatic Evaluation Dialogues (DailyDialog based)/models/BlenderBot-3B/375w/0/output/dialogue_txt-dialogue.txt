B|5| Human 2: [maybe] _you_ [get] 25 presents . 
A|6| Human 1: _i think_ _it_ _was_ _australia_ 
B|7| Human 2: [australia] ! [i] love that place [where] everything wants [to] kill _you_ . 
A|8| Human 1: not _really_ . [the] interactions _are_ _usually_ short-lived _but it's_ fascinating [to] learn [where] _people are_ coming _from_ _and what_ matters [to] them 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [really] love [it] when [people are] trying [to] [get to] know me [and what] kind [of] things we like or [where] we [are] [from] .

A|12| Human 1: wow _! _that's_ interesting_ , borderline spooky 
B|13| Human 2: oh [really] ? [that's interesting] [and] [i think] [you] [are] probably right ! [the] [people] [from] [the] southern hemisphere [are] much spookier 
A|14| Human 1: [so] , _do_ [you] _do_ treasure hunting often ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [do] , [but] [i] [was] never very good at [it] [! that's] [usually] why [i] like [to] [do] [it] with [people] [from] my childhood who [are] still
