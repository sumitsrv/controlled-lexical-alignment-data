Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I miss mine, too, but they're in the wild again.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I'm sad too. I've tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name too! I just miss her so much
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would just visit the Grand Canyon again.  I've never been and you could say it's a vacation idea for life.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I've heard the Grand Canyon is great. I would go there and just take in all those beautiful sights!
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I've never been there but my brothers and sisters say it would definitely be awesome. It sounds like an experience to just be right on top
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I've heard you need one of those zipline and ropes, then there are some that are just walking from the top of a tree to
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 I would not want to be one of the people zip lining and then being swept away
