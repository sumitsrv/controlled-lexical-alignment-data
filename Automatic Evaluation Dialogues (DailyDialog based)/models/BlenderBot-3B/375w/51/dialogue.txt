Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Oh good. It's been pretty boring, but my friends went out and got me dinner, which I've never had done before! How about yourself
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been great! I had like 5 friends over for some beers with pizza and watching some movies.
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm about to go fishing with some friends that I haven't been able to see in ages!
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm going fishing with some friends later. It's been a long time, but my favorite part about weekends is that no plans are made
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 Just going over to the cabin I bought. I'm not that interested in fishing. I like to drink beer though, its nice!
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I think the city is nice and New Yorkers are super cool there, but some things about living in the city itself are a bit overkill
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I've been there, the city is such a cool place! What do you like about Tokyo?
