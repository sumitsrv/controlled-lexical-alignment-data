Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I am doing well. I'm watching the game with my son. He got youth soccer on the tv and I was playing with my new
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, getting ready for tonight's soccer game! I think it's going to be a good one. Did you have fun cleaning
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I love doing work outside and enjoy it very much, but cleaning a little bit isn't that bad. what's going on tonight at the game
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I enjoy it because it's work and you are accomplishing something but it's not the most fun. 
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I just watched a little bit of my favorite show, but now I have to do my homework.
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 hahaha that's the spirit! but it never happened there you will forget
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 the ending was bad but it is the only time I saw Terminators in theaters!
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 I am not a spoiler fan at all. that's the only reason I want to watch it so bad
Human 1:	 Thanks!
