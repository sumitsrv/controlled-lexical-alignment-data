Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm good thanks, what about you?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book "Ripleys' Believe it or Not"! It is so great, you are going to love it
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm doing good. I love reading that book, have you read the other book that was based off of it?
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I have read that book! I like how the author focuses on science but does not shy away from the humanities. One good fact is
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I read that book but it was in like 2007 and I'm not sure what it's about.
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 you might like the book then because it's also about startups and innovation. that's what the author does well.
Human 1:	 yup!
