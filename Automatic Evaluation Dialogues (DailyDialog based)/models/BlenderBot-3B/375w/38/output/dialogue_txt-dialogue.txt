A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: not [like chat bots] . _i think_ [you] _are_ thinking [about] [chat] apps , which _are_ usually web chatting apps _with_ user interfaces , where [you] 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have_ made _some_ _great_ progress over last few _years_ . do [you] [think] _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: not really . _i think_ _they_ [have] been around [some] [years] _now_ but [the] whole idea _is_ _a_ bit outdated _and_ over-saturated _with_ bot 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? _though_ _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [it] _is_ [the] [chat bots] _i think_ _are_ [great] , but not [like] impersination . 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ _that_ ! [some] of _these_ _bots _are_ very_ _engaging_ [and] _funny ._ [they] [are] [now] _good at_ _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far [are] _we_ from [the] time _these_ [bots] _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: they've [even] been around since [the] 90s [and] [are very] [good at] impersonating humans ! _i think_ that's [funny .] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] _can_ take many different forms as [a] product . [the] _research_ implication [is] _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ signify how ai _research_ has progressed so far [and] _better_ place _to_ tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be_ _overselling it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [more] [i] [research] [the] [more] [i think] [that] [you] [might be] right [and] [that] [bots are] [better] than [some] humans [these] days . [though] [we] [can] [also] program 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions _already_ do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [true] [and] [i think] [that] [the current] [research] [will] [have] [to] [start] [now] since [these] new [bots] [can] [already] give us [better] advice [and] make [more] [engaging] _conversation_ 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this [conversation] [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [you] [are very] much [overselling it] [haha] .
