Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Good, just working on this paper.
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 Not to bad, was that a day that was supposed to be productive but didn't pan out like that?
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that. What was going on with you and what did you do for the project?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I lost my job and my loved one that was on a flight home. 
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 Lol I was working on it for a project and forgot how long it had been going on and that day was one of the days I got it done
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I'm trying to save money. It's going pretty well but it's really tiring. What are you trying to save for?
