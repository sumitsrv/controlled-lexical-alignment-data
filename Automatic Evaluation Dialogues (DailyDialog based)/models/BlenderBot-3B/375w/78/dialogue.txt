Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 Who said I want to?
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 I'm not psychic but sometimes wish that I was.
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I'm not psychic, I guess that was a lucky guess you have the ability to feel the pastry chef
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 Cooking and baking have always been a favorite pass time of mine, icing or not! I'm so impressed that you're able to feel
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I'm not a big chef, for some reason I can't enjoy the work that goes into it.  I'm all about eating haha
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 I work for a local bakery that specializes in  and cooks all types of cake and pastries. I enjoy working there. 
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I work for a company that cooks the same kind of cake you make- the vanilla cheesecake with the icing like you did
