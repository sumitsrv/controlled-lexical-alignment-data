Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I can't complain! How are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 I'm good, thanks! Just ready to watch some basketball. How are you?
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I see them play quite some times because I'm good friend with the head coach Grizzlies.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I'm well, the heat has started, more like a headache with all these people going to the game and all these sweaters on! Haha
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 Haha I'm with you there! The New York Chairs name is so cheesy
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 I don't know the origin of that nickname but all I know is that The New York Chairs is from the movie NeurI
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 NeurIPS is the abbreviation of Neur IPS that stands for Near-sighted in person
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Yes that was very scary movie about the future. I saw with my father once. What a dystopian future we lived into
