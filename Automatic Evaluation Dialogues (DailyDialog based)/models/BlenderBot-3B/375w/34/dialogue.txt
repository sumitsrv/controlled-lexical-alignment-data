Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 Yes, I am talking about thanksgiving. It is the best! It is one of the happiest holidays of the year here in
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 No thanksgiving for us here. We have a different Holiday, the harvest festival. That's great you get to plan
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 thanksgiving is the biggest holiday in canada, you are right about being the fifth, do you live here?
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 yes the thanksgiving feast with the whole family and then christmas for me!
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 I love the fact that for some years I have to buy everything and prepare the whole meal from scratch.
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	 Yes the whole meal for me and that is just family, no one ever buys me stuff, so its always nice.
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
