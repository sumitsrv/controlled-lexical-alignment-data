Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Nice to meet you! Is this your first time doing something like this?
Human 2:	 No, this time I can actually meet a few people so I don't have a huge amount of people I've never met before. 
Human 1:	 I have been with the company for over 3 years. Stick with the same team What about you?
Human 2:	 Nice to meet you, first time for this, yeah, I have been with this company about the same amount of years.
Human 1:	 That sounds like a perfect plan!
Human 2:	 That's the plan for this time anyway. Nice to meet you. What do you like about your company?
Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	 That's nice, you can try something different like <REDACTED>
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	 That's a good suggestion. I can try the lunch meetups and then decide later if we have something to try for dinner as well. Let me
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
