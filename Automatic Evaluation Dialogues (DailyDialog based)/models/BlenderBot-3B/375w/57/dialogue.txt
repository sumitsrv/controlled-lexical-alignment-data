Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 Just great. I'm going camping later today. How was your day?
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I've been writing papers and practicing my twiddle thumbs. You're lucky! How long will you be camping?
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I would love to get off work and go twiddle my thumbs too.
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 I've been writing about things happening in the world, and it's been a good day.
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 Nice. I would love to see the world

Human 2:	 I would too, that sounds like a great adventure. Australia is the most diving and breathing with all these wild and scary animals. I
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 That's too bad! It would be amazing and terrifying to see that much underwater diving with all the animals
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 You and me both. It's too expensive to just hop on a plane and head there that's for sure.
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
