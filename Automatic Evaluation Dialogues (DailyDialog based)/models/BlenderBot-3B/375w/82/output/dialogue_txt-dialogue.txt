B|3| Human 2: _i was_ [looking] _at_ something and _i_ came across _a_ comment _about_ _the_ chatting room _on_ reddit .

B|5| Human 2: [just looking] _for_ [the] [chat] room [about] [cigar] and found _this_ and wanted someone [to] talk [to] ... _what_ did _you_ find ? 
A|6| Human 1: [this] _one_ is _actually_ from peru , which is _more_ _my_ taste _. smoking_ _isn't_ _very_ healthy , _but_ _it's_ _actually_ quite _relaxing_ , which _in_ [a] way is _good _for_ your health ._ _haha_ 
B|7| Human 2: [just] [the] usual [haha] . [it's] [good for] [relaxing] [but] [very] bad [for your health [.] smoking] [more] than [one] [cigar] [a] day [isn't] 
A|8| Human 1: [haha] "you only _live_ once" as _they say_ ! 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [actually] [just] had [one] [about] 30 minutes ago [for] [the] [very] first time . [they] have _it_ [in] [my] local [cigar] shop . 
A|10| Human 1: [haha] , _that_ is _not_ [what] [i was] getting [at] , [but] _yes_ _that_ _would be nice_ . do [you] believe [in] _reincarnation_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [yes] [what] [was] [that] like [for] [you] ? _it_ makes [you] [live] once [but] [not] [for] [good] [haha] 
A|12| Human 1: do [you] _think_ neural link _will_ allow [you] [to] [live] after death ? [i] thought [it] [was] [just] [a] brain-computer interface . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [think] [reincarnation] [would be nice] [but] [not] [for] me , [it] [just] seems too weird . [the] afterlife and [what] happens there [will] [just] 
A|14| Human 1: ahh [i] _see_ . [that] is [a] much harder task , no ? 
B|15| Human 2: that's [what] [they say] . [i] [think] [it] [would be nice] [just] [to] [see] [my] old faces again with [more] confidence 
A|16| Human 1: depends [on] how [good] [the] brain dump is [i] suppose ...
