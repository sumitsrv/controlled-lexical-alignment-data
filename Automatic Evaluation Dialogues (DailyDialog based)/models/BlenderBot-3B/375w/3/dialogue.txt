Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Yes I think so. I have the muddy yard today.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 They do, the rain is really bad too since we don't have much that drains to help
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 that's the worst, when the rain started early! Where do you grew up if it's in the midwest?
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 I grew up in the Midwest too. Just don't have much rain this year.
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I grew up in the north lol. I don't think I would have ever survived here if there had been weather like that!
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 Yea this was pretty bad here too but it did make people think you could have droughts that never happened before. People can't grasp the
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
