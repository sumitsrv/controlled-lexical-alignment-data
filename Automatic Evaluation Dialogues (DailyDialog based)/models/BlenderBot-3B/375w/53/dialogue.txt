Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty good! The work will be busy but it's worth it in the end.
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I have a break from work for the first time in forever.
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Well, you know what they say, have fun while you can, so that the work will be for fun!  It's going well!
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I like the run for fun, I just started that recently
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 Haha well I hope you like it. Running is such a fun sport
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I have run marathons before for fun, but not in like 8 years, so I'm looking forward to getting started again!
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I like running marathons every year. It's a lot of fun and gives me something to shoot for in the New year
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 I can't run marathons, not long enough days to recover! How was the half-marathon for you?
