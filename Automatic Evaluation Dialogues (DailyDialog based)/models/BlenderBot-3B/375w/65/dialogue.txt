Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hi! going well.. How are your's?? I'm trying to find time to watch something.. I love it..
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 How's your day going so far?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 Oh no! I hope your mechanic finds a way to figure out what the problem is so that you can get back on the road soon!
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Okay the work I had today wasn't good at all lol. My mechanic that was supposed to finish my moped fixed a transmission and now
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 I don't think so, the way I drive. Did you have a good night last night?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Haha. I am fine! but you should get your car checked too.
