Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 How is your day going?
Human 2:	 Pretty good so far yourself?
Human 1:	 How is your day?
Human 2:	 It has been going well so far. How about you?
Human 1:	 I went to gym and worked on weight lifting.
Human 2:	 Good, and yours? I went to the gym too!
Human 1:	 No, I am just a starter.
Human 2:	 I just came back from the gym and I am doing great! I think I lifted too much weight tho
Human 1:	 I go everyday. In fact, I'm in a running challenge.
Human 2:	 I'm just taking a break from weight lifting now and running everyday to stay healthy
Human 1:	 It's actually not that impressive. I can only run. I cannot lift weight.
Human 2:	 I can lift weights and run fast just not that much and not everyday. It's only happened a couple of times!
Human 1:	 Oh that's a really interesting idea. I like to be coa
