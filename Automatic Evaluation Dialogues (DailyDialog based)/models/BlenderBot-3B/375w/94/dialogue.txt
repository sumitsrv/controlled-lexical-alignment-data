Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 Hey, you there? Hows it going
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 I had some delicious and spicy beef stew.  It came with some really delicious rice and potatoes, but you can't beat
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm having some chicken and shrimp for lunch. Where do you work?
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I bet you are having some really healthy lunch and the environment was not affected. I am currently working in packing house for fish food.
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I've tried some vegetarian and I love the different kinds of meats like chicken. Have you had them before though? They are pretty expensive.
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I have tried it once.  But not for too long. What's the food like?
