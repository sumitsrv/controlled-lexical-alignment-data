A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , _thanks_ . _i'm trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm trying [to] make] _some_ [croissants] myself right _now_ . [it's] hard [to] find _a good_ yeasted flatbread . 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice so far , _but they_ haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm trying to] figure _out_ why . what kind _of_ cookies _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i'm trying] [out] _a_ [croissants] [made] [of] [flakey] bread recipe . [it's] [been] _a_ while [but they] are delicious . 
A|6| Human 1: ah , [good] thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [good] [thanks] [trying] [make] _a_ croissant . 
A|8| Human 1: [now] _that is_ [a good] idea . i'll give it [a] try _next_ _time_ . would _you say_ _you_ _have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [them] _with_ [sweet tooth] [that is] very [good] [but they] do take [time] [to make] , [you] _need_ _the_ yeast [to] ferment 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me too , [i] _think_ _i'd_ eat pastries all [the] [time] if [i] could get away [with] it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i'd] [say] [the] [croissants] [that] use [the] sugar _and_ flour [have a sweet tooth] [but] [don't] [think] they've ever used [the] y 
A|12| Human 1: _wow_ ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat _substitute_ , [and] caused all sorts [of] _crazy_ stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [wow] _that's_ [crazy] [you say] [that] [i] [was] just [trying to] [have a sweet] past [and] realized [the] recipe calls for [a] sugar [substitute] . [the] [next] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] [need] [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
