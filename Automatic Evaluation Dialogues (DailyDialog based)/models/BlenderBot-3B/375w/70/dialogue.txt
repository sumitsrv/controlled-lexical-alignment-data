Human 2:	 I was going to make an edit for you, I am a rockstar for sure
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 Just a little music for some friends, I play guitar as well!
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 Yeah I can't play them well enough for the time being, still practicing though!
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 It's like the alphabets for sure. Just keep practicing you'll get them down. That took me months to figure out.
