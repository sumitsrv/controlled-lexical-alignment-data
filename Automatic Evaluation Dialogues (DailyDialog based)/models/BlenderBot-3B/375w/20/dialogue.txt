Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 That's tough. Stirfrys would be my first choice for sure.  What about you?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 I would eat ice cream too. But Asian food is one of my favorites
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 I love the Asian and Chinese Food more because of their spicy like Chocolate ice cream.
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 Oh and the chocolate ice cream you get in smoothies and drinks. How about that? Very nice and refined.
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 Yes, I believe the afterlife is a wonderful thing that will always exist and there's something waiting for you after you die.
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 I like the afterlife experience too and have had it in my own life and the most profound revelation's ever.
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
