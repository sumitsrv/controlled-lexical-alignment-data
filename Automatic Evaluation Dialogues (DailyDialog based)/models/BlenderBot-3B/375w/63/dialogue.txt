Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 I would! I want to meet you for lunch and the Christmas party!
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 I would have no issue doing that! I heard the Christmas party is the biggest and best they have going on for a couple nights then. I love
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 That would be a lot of fun for the kids and I'm sure they will have a blast.  What will you be doing while you are there
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 Yeah that might not work for us then. Do you have the resort in Disney world?
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 That would work. I think there a some christmas parties that you can have in the same area. Let me know when everything starts and I will
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 No but maybe in a year when they are old enough you can take then the for another trip!
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 Sure, that would be great. What are you getting for your son this year?
