Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I think it went OK...I finished! I finished under time and I am pretty happy about that. 
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 Yes the marathon coming up. I am training for 5 months and ready to go
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 It's not just the race you are doing to improve your health and performance but for the community and spirit which is why you want to do Spart
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 Its a race and you run over a mile which is like 7 miles but the obstacles are fun and challenging
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 Wow, 5 months for that one? Are you doing to enter the Spartan Race in New York next February like they had on
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 It's the one time you can workout indoors for months at once, it has over 1 million participants so I think we should do
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 Yeah, the obstacles are pretty challenging for me. But with time and training, I'll do great. That's about next week
