A|6| Human 1: [i] _like_ _doing_ _spartan race_ . _it's_ an obstacle _race_ _which is_ _challenging_ _but_ _not_ overtly _so_ _like_ marathons [and] triathlons 
B|7| Human 2: [it's] [not] just [the] [race] [you] [are] [doing] [to] improve [your] health [and] performance [but] _for_ [the] community [and] spirit [which is] why [you] want [to do] spart
