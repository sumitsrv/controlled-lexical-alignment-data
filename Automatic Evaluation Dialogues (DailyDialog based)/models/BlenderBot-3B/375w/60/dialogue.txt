Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 Hello, good. How are you? I am doing very well. Just watching the sunset. It's beautiful here outside
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was great I climbed up the roof of my house and had good weather. How was the rock climbing
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was the movie that's about a boy climbing some rock formations with his friends. What did you do this weekend?
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 Haha that's great! I saw the movie the Dark Knight Rises and they all look very similar, same darkness and shadowing. What
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 It was good fun climbing outdoors on the rock wall, it's been nice and warm lately. What movie are you talking about?
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 Yes I've been there, it can be very scary out when you get that dark like that!
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I've been meaning to visit AUS and see the southern lights too, are they that good?
