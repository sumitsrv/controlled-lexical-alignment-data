Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Pretty good been watching all the marvel movies!
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I think you should too, cold's are the worst with flu like symptoms
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'm the same you'll even have to stay home for your sick time with out the medication too and no one wants that.
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I have never been that sick in my life you feel bad for days. Do you have any plans this weekend?
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I have never been there either it's going to be good to see all the big beaches. It's like a whole new place.
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 That's so good to have the lotion for your hands, I'm going to be there with my family this weekend.
