B|3| Human 2: well , [i've been pondering] about your situation since [i] read this comment . _are_ you ok ? 
A|4| Human 1: _my_ partner's former _friend_ invited _me_ for lunch (they [are] _not_ in _good_ books _right_ now) . _but_ during _their_ _friendship_ [i] _formed_ an independent _bond_ _with_ _the_ _other_ _person_ _because_ we _all_ _used to_ hang _out_ _a_ lot . _now_ _i feel like_ [i] _have_ _to_ take sides . 
B|5| Human 2: [i've been] there [with] [a] [friendship] [like] _that_ _. it's_ hard [because] _they_ [have] [all] [the] [good] qualities [other] than [their] [person] [not] being there [right] 
A|6| Human 1: [i] hope [they] do . getting older already means smaller circles . _it_ sucks _to_ lose _friends_ for arbitrary reasons . _that's good_ advice _though_ _. i_ fear raising [the] issue might sound [like] treason . lol . 
B|7| Human 2: [that's good] [though] [right] ? you [have] [the] [bond] [they] [used to] [have] [with] [their] [friend] [now] and [are] building one [with] you _. it's_ [all] [good] . 
A|8| Human 1: aka _avoiding_ [all] texts from _everyone_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _that_ makes sense [. [i] feel like] [they] [are] [avoiding] [me] [now] [because] [the] [bond] _is_ [formed] [with] them [not] [me] [. i] think _it's_ [because] [everyone] 
A|10| Human 1: people _always_ say [to] _find_ [a] balance _but never_ say _what_ [the] balance [is] [. it's] [used] so often _that it's_ vacuous . 
B|11| Human 2: [that it's] [the] truth [that] [friendship] [always] comes [with] [a] price [but] [they] [never] know [what] [their] true [friends] [are] [like] unless [they] [find] them self [out] there 
A|12| Human 1: lol _. i'm_ finna be single .
