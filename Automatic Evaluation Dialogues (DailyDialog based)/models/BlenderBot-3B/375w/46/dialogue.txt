Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 Well, I've been pondering about your situation since I read this comment.  Are you ok?
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I've been there with a friendship like that. It's hard because they have all the good qualities other than their person not being there right
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's good though right? You have the bond they used to have with their friend now and are building one with you. It's all good.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 That makes sense. I feel like they are avoiding me now because the bond is formed with them not me. I think it's because everyone
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 That it's the truth that friendship always comes with a price but they never know what their true friends are like unless they find them self out there
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 That's the case. I'm always thinking that everyone but never know it. It's just my luck.
