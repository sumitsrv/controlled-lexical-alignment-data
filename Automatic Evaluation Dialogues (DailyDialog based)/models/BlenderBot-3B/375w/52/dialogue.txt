Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 I am great, are you familiar with microkitchens they serve a lot of different kinds of food. I would love some goodies
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 Yeah that seems cold! Do they have jacket there?
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 Its cold even in the summer, its good that they are out there for us at a time like this.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 I live out in the boondocks in northern Michigan
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live in the south where you don't get cold except for maybe the occasional winter.  We're expecting a lot of snow soon, and
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 Nice, the colder weather should give you more time for snowboarding!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 Yes! The cold and snow will get better for the one in our floor.
