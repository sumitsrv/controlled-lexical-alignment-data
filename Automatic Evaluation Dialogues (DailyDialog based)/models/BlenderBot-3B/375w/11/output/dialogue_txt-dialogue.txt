A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [hi] _. i_ [have] _to_ say roses . but [you] should know _that flower_ love _does_ _not_ equal love for romance . romance _is_ _not_ always 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working _on_ _a_ _theory ._ why [does] _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] had [the lotus] tattooed [on] me for _over_ [a] year . _it_ means [a] lot [to] me _and_ _it_ has been one _of_ my [favourite] flow 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ [not] research ! _just_ [a] personal _theory [._ _i] think_ [that flower] preferences _are_ more revealing [of] personality than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] _that's a_ good [theory .] i've thought [the] same thing when getting [flower] tattoos . _it_ [does] [not] [have] [to] mean love , but 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . _as_ if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then [it] came [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [like] [the lotus] [flower] [and] [it's] symbolic meaning in ancient india . [it] _is_ associated [with] divination , wisdom [and] [life] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their_ [favourite] [flower] [is] . pretty much [like] what we _just_ did . [does] [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [like] [that] [you] [like] [it] because flowering plants [are] beautiful [and] [not] [just] for [their] color 
A|12| Human 1: _cool ._ step 2: talk [with] [the] person some more , [and] ask _them_ some more questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , [over] [the] course [of] maybe _two_ [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: _that's_ [cool [.] i] had [two] friends [with] [flower] tattoo , [the] first they [just] [like] [the] look [of] [them] [and] wanted [the] tattoo [as] [their] own way 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's a] wonderful idea !
