Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Hi. I have to say roses. But you should know that flower love does not equal love for romance. Romance is not always
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I have had the lotus tattooed on me for over a year. It means a lot to me and it has been one of my favourite flow
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I think that's a good theory. I've thought the same thing when getting flower tattoos. it does not have to mean love, but
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 I like the lotus flower and it's symbolic meaning in ancient India. It is associated with divination, wisdom and life
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I like that you like it because flowering plants are beautiful and not just for their color
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 that's cool. I had two friends with flower tattoo, the first they just like the look of them and wanted the tattoo as their own way
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
