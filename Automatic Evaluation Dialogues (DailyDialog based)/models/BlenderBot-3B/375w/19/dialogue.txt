Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 That superman was so cool the movie about the man that had powers or the comic book superhero?
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 You are the superman? Awesome, What about you is invisible?
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 fMRI has a lot of problems. You can't see the brain and that would not be very trustworthy.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 The superman thing is pretty cool, the brain imaging thing that you can see through clothing and stuff.
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 The brain's imaging thing is pretty cool. The MRIs can resolve a variety of conditions.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 I'm bad at Science too. But the brain is very important for most of human activity
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 Yea I can see where you are coming from. Science is important and it really helps advance the understanding that we have of the world around us.
