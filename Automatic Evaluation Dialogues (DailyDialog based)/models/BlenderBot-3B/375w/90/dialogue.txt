Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 Sure sounds like fun! I am volunteering for it next week, you should go!
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 That sounds like fun! I'd love to participate if everything goes well and I have the time.
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 Sounds fun! I like sports events and have never participated before. What event will you be volunteering for?
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I think the event will be for some type of community outreach, i have never volunteer before but its something i've been wanting to
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 I think the ultimate for saturday, are you with any other volunteers?  how long have you volunteered before?
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 the event is for volunteering at the youth center and we are discussing how to organize some activities with them for next saturday
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 well you have a reserve. The event should be organized and set up before the next saturday with your help for sure, so its ready
Human 1:	 Thanks.
