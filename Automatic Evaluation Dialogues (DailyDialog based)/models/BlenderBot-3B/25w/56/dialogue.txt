Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 nice meeting you. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 Just taking a few moments of rest for my feet.  I think I might do the dishes later.
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	 I could go for a steak right now. Or tacos with sour cream. You?
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	 I could eat a lot of food. Japanese cuisine was heavily influenced by China, especially in the early 21st century.
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	 I like Ramen a lot. The flavor and spicy noodle cuisine comes from northern Japan.  Do you
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	 Dojo has the best Japanese food in San Mateo. I love everything spicy too.  Have you tried it?
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	 Yes, I have a great place a few blocks from my apartment. The noodles are soft and thicker compared to the stuff you get in
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
