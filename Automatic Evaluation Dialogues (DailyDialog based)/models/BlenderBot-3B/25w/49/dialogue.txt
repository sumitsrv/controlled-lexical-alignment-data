Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Fantastic, it's about time to go out in the sun again, it's too cold in the house.
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 Good morning, it is great out today! I'm looking forward to taking my son swimming! How are you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 It is going to be hot today! I am really excited for the weekend
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 I am going to watch it live! I haven't seen a shark since I was a kid, I can't wait!
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 i love UFC.  I can't wait for this weekends fight. i like all the fights really but I want to see Jon Jones win
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 It's going to be a good one this weekend. I might have to go and catch a couple before they start to run out of tickets.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah dude I'm not that great at it but it's still a fun time! I hope you have a good time.
