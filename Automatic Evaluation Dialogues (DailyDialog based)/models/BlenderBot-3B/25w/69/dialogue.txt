Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	 Hello, I am having fun! How are you?
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 I ate the Turkish delight. I was in a hurry and it was already in the fridge for me.
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	 It was nice. We made some Turkey and stuffing. It turned out well I thought
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 It was home cooked! I love my turkey stuffing and gravy!
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 I love turkey, I always grill mine over the fire, it is so tasty.  Do you?
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 I have! I always loved it as a child. My mom would always make us turkey and ham every Thanksgiving.
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 Yes, we had a lot of games like that as well.  We would use the turkey as a prop for some and stuff it with things
