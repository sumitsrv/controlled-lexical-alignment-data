Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Pretty good. I'm on a diet so I eat healthy. Do you have any hobbies?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 Hey there I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I am studying at college and you
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 That's cool! I am also an avid potter. Do you have any favorites to sew?
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 I like knitting because it's something I'm really good at. It's so relaxing and creative and time consuming.
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 I'm a bit of a potter too but I love tea! But it's a hard to do because I work so much, I don't
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 My favorite is probably the one I'm currently drinking, Earl Grey. What kind would you like to make?
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 I love tea as well. The teas that we drink from China are different then the Tea originated in India. There were many tea cult
