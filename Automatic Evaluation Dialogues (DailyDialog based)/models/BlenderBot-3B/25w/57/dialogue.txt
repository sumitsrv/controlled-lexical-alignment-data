Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 Great! Thank you!  I am going down to the beach for a day.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I've been doing the same thing, I wish I could have just relaxed at home and not go to work today
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I hear you, my work is always so busy and I hate it!
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 Do you have any hobbies? I love playing soccer so sometimes I like to go by the beach and watch people play
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would like to see all the beaches.
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 I like to go diving but only when its low tide because I don't want to get stuck.  I hate tide pools!
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 I love the beach! It's one of my favorite places to be. That is too bad about not being to fly for so long. That
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 Oh no, did you see a lot of dead animals? I hate that!
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
