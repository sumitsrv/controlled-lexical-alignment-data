B|3| Human 2: great ! thank _you_ _! i_ am [going] down _to_ _the_ beach for _a_ _day ._ 
A|4| Human 1: _oh_ _, _i_ would_ _love_ [to] twiddle _my_ thumbs . you're _so_ lucky ! _today_ , _i've been_ mostly attending meetings , reading _and_ writing docs , reading papers etc . 
B|5| Human 2: [i've been] doing _the_ same thing [, _i] wish i_ could have _just_ relaxed at home [and] not go [to] _work_ [today] 
A|6| Human 1: wow [! i] _sometimes_ drift off during [work] , [and] _see_ similar things in _my_ head . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] hear _you_ , [my] [work] [is] always [so] busy [and] [i] hate [it] ! 
A|8| Human 1: mostly saving [the] world from mess on social media . how _about_ [you] ? 
B|9| Human 2: _do_ [you] have any hobbies ? [i] [love] playing soccer [so] [sometimes] [i] like [to] go [by] [the] beach [and] watch people play 
A|10| Human 1: nice , what _all_ _places_ _would_ [you] _be_ [going] [to] ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i would] like [to] [see] [all] [the] beaches . 
A|12| Human 1: [i] [just] met someone who went _diving_ in australia . apparently , [you] cannot _fly_ 24 hrs after [you] dive , _because_ [your] body accumulates _too_ much <redacted_term> _when_ breathing with [a] cylinder [so] , _don't_ [do] _that !_ 
B|13| Human 2: [i] like [to] go [diving] but only [when] its low tide [because] [i] [don't] want [to] get stuck . [i] hate tide pools ! 
A|14| Human 1: that's equally amazing [! [i] wish i] can explore such _places_ _one_ [day .] _it's_ [just] [so] expensive 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [love] [the] beach ! [it's] [one] of [my] favorite [places] [to] [be] . [that] [is] [too] bad [about] not being [to] [fly] for [so] long . [that] 
A|16| Human 1: woah !... [you] know sharing [is] caring . [you] should share [that] money with me :) 
B|17| Human 2: [oh] no , did [you] [see] [a] lot of dead animals ? [i] hate [that !]
