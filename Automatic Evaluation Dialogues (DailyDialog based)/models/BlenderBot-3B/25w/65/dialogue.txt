Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Great! I have plans to see a movie
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 Well, it's going okay. I just had to walk a lot to get to work.
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 That is terrible - hopefully the mechanic has a way to get you towed home
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Yeah, I don't mind! I'm glad you made it back okay.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 I should be fine. I just wanted to make sure. Did you think I was a good driver?
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Yes I do. They are really strong, I was shocked to be honest.
