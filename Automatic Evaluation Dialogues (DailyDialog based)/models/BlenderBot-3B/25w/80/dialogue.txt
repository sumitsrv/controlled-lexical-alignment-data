Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 How was the trip last weekend?
Human 2:	 Hi! Not too bad. I was very sick for a week but it turned out I had mono so I had to get treated!
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places did you cover?
Human 2:	 My job, my home, and I took a trip to the beach. How was yours?
Human 1:	 I am actually attending cooking classes over the weekends.
Human 2:	 Oh I'm so jealous, my girlfriend got food poisoning the week of the beach last year, it was the worst.
Human 1:	 True! they started with some basic zucchini based dish. We may try cooking some italian dish later this week.
Human 2:	 Ooh, zucchini is a very nice fresh vegetable. I actually just made italian the other day! 
Human 1:	 Nice! I hope to volunteer to cook for the team in our next team offsite :)
Human 2:	 I hope it turns out good for you! I haven't had it before I always wanted to try it. I'm not a good cook though so
Human 1:	 Sure, I will love to invite you and your family for a meal over the holidays. Have you guys made any other plans?
Human 2:	 I hope you do too! The dish will be so much better than any frozen food!
