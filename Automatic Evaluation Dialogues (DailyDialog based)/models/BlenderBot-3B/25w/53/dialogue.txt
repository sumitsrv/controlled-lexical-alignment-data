Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Hey! Yes it is, I've just been working on a research essay. How was your day?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well.  I got a good bit of work done today so my mind is rested before the holidays.  You?
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Not too much fun. I got a lot of school work to do
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I've not started yet. I think I'll just do some laundry and finish up some work.
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I don't like running that much but i'll take some hot showers.
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 Thats a good start.. you will have to keep with it, its a long, long journey.. i started the running program back in june
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 that is awesome, i hope it goes well! I have no idea how long a marathon is but it sure is long. Good luck!!!
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 It's a 10K race, so not too long
