Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 I don't, but I bet I met you somewhere before. What have we done before that we might have met?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 I believe so, I know that I met you a while back and we were at the same bar
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 I was not there, but maybe it was a different schwasty I met. I work in the publishing industry and travel a lot
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I was at the club last night and one of your patients tried to grab my ass! You should have been there
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 No I don't know what that's, but I'm sure it's not a nice thing to have happened! Are you a male or a female
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 What type of publishing industry? If it has anything to do with the newspaper, it sounds very interesting. I'm a man.
