Human 2:	 It was wonderful! I got to have a very long break from school and spend a lot of time with my friends and family. 
Human 1:	 Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?
Human 2:	 Oh yes, I was there with my girlfriend but the locals and other travelers can be harsh.
Human 1:	 Hehe! How long was the stay?
Human 2:	 Yes, and in the end I had to fly home and deal with the consequences of my travels, but it was still amazing!
