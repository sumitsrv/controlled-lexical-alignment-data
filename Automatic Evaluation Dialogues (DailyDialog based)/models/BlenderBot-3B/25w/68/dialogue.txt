Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry.  Is your professor teaching you in person or over the web and do you have a textbook?
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	 No, I have the powerpoint that she gave to me, but I cannot read it right now
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 That was my concern, and no I do not have time to meet up tonight.
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 I think we are going over the syllabus, but I don't have a class this week and I am not really sure how to study
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 I'm sure the syllabus will have a lot of information but I am also confident I can still read it.
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 I will try to study for the next week then
