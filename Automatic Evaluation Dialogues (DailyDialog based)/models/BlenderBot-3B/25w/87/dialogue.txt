Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm just hanging out with my boyfriend of two years and catching up with him. He's away at college. You?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm having coffee and a bowl of pasta. It's one of my favorites
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I've not read it in a while but it was quite good. It had a good moral to it. I'm reading a book on politics.
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I am going to read a book on my favorite author.  Whats your book about?
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 It's about the book business and the impact of it in a small town in the United States and how an author's books change the way people live
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 Oh, sounds interesting I might have to look it up. My book is about the history of philosophy, but it was published in 2006
Human 1:	 yup!
