Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	 I've been great, just relaxing.
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 Wow that's crazy. Did you hurt yourself?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	 No I do not. I wish I did but I do know that is a lot more difficult to learn than Spanish.
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 I didn't hurt myself luckily but yes, it seems everyone and thing around town wants to speak french now. I've only been to Mont
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I've been to Montreal a lot, I went to the Olympics twice actually
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I can't even say anything that I just wanted to say or do without being afraid to get hurt
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 Oh that's cool. Do you think you could learn a little french?
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
