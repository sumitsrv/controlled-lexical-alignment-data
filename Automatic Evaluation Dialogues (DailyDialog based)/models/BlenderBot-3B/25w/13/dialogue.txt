Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I have! Have you seen it for the last time yet? It is directed by John Carpenter, the genius!
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 Hi. I saw an early screening of The Parasite and got to watch the previews for it at the movie theater.
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 I saw it yesterday, I can't wait to see the new Star Wars movie!
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 I saw the movie as well! I can't wait to watch it again and see how things change!
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I don't think I can watch the new Star Wars movies myself either I've only watched a couple, the old ones hold up a lot more
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I loved it, the original trilogy was great, not much I can compare with the first three movies.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I've never seen Spider-man.  I think I missed the boat there.  It's been so long.
