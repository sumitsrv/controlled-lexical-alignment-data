Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 That sounds like a lot of fun. I've always wanted to skydive
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I have never been but it would be fun.
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 I haven't but I would really like to go one day! I've heard it's intense and scary.
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 Yes I have, I've done a few! I went tandem, and I'm glad I did even though it was terrifying.
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I do love it! I live right by White Waters, Michigan and they have some great places for skiing and skateboarding
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I've only once, when I was very young and I did pretty well. I was just scared to fall. I don't think I ever made
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
