Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	 Hello! I'm so happy to be off work, I have an exciting weekend ahead
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	 I've been great! I can't wait for it to be over though. I'm ready to go back home and relax.
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	 Good morning! I'm having a lot of free time right now since my work is slacking!
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	 I like to relax after work. I would rather be home playing video games, however, I am still trying to figure out how to be the highest
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 I know right!! I don't really want to know about that either. My dad was always the type who didn't like it.
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	 Good evening.  I'm having a lot of time with my son and the acupuncturists.  It does seem strange but
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	 Wow you're a comic that's so cool, what kind are you in to?
