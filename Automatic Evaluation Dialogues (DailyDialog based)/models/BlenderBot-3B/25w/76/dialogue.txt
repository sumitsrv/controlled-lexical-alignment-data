Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. Deja Vu.
Human 1:	 what does that mean?
Human 2:	 Hi, that means I've experienced a situation before, or even a memory that I've had. It's hard to believe sometimes. Do you experience
Human 1:	 Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?
Human 2:	 I think it has to do with being awake long enough to get that feeling and waking up to your thoughts being a memory from the past,
Human 1:	 How do you know so much about this French phrase?
Human 2:	 It means exactly what you think. My wife tells me I'm always in the same place or saying the same things, like a past memory. 
Human 1:	 yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.
Human 2:	 I think you are right. I know it's just an illusion but i get so scared lol.
Human 1:	 wdym by word origins here?
Human 2:	 You know...the word that means remembering and recollection and recall and the like. I know it's used as much when someone is talking
Human 1:	 Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂
Human 2:	 yeah, I know what you mean. I get that alot too
Human 1:	 My friend used to tell me this and found it funny - Mosquitos have 47 teeths
