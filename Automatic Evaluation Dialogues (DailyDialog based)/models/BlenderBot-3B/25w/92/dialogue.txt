Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 It was a good day! It was my birthday so I had cake and cake-shaped icecream and went to the park with my friends
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 I took the dogs outside, we ran around, and ate lunch. It was a good day.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 Haha, that sounds like a good day for a birthday, I love the beach in the summer months. I was at work all day, I
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 Are you from the US? I work in the office so I did not go out to the beach.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 I've thought about it but I can't do that kind of work near the ocean. It makes me too anxious!
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 It can be dangerous, but the benefits outweigh the risks. The work gives great benefits! It's a very stable career. 
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 No I'm not from the US, but most mountain climbers do not use ropes when using the route!
