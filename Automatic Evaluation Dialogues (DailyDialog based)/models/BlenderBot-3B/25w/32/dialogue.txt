Human 1:	 Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?
Human 2:	 I like lunches, they're more convenient and cheaper than dinners for me
Human 1:	 We can check the menu then decide :)
Human 2:	 Yes, it is a lot less work then trying to go out and eat lunch. And I can bring my laptop to the meeting and browse
Human 1:	 Sure. See you then!
