Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I really loved Frozen but it's been a long time. I'm a bit of an old guy, been watching these sorts of movies since
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 I'm a fan of action movies. Avatar is the movie with blue people right?
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I've seen Frozen. I don't really see people watching movies lately, but I'm watching it later tonight with my kids.
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 I love those kinds of movies.  Frozen was such a great movie with a great soundtrack and a great storyline.
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 A lot of different cuisines - I like Italian and Japanese food best.
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 I do make homemade food! I'm a baker and love making all kinds of different things. Fresh pasta is my favorite
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 I am the same way! I love making all kinds of soups and chili from scratch, though I cannot bake.
