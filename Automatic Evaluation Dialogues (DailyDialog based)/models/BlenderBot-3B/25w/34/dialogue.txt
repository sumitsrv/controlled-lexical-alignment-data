Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 I plan to enjoy some time with my wife and kids. 
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 I love Thanksgiving because it's my birthday. I have always been so grateful for the harvest and my new home. Do you
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 I hope my family celebrates it with the turkey at my house. I think it'll be fun.
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 Yeah, I think it would be nice to spend the whole day surrounded by family. I would have a great time with the food and bever
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 I'm so excited. I have to buy a turkey! It's gonna cost a fortune and I'm so ready. 
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
