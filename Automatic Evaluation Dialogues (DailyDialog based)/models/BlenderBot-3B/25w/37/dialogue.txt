Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great. Doing some studying for finals right now.
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I would like to exercise with someone but my friends usually aren't available
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great! Yeah the Switch is definitely good for groups exercise, but you have to find games that are fun to play with others
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I'd say it's worth it. There are quite a bit of games you can play with others on the Switch.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I like that book too! It's called "War and Peace" by James Joyce
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 Ooh that is a good read. I'll have to add it to the list for the Switch. It's good to be social.
