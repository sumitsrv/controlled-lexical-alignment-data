Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great, I'm a big baseball fan and I was watching a game
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 Going to have dinner with old friends and catching up.
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 I'm just relaxing, no plans. I'll probably stay at home and play some Xbox. Do you have any plans this weekend?
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 Oh nice, where in Spain? I was looking to go there to the Pyrenees. 
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 It was so hard to learn! That's what spanish sounds like when they put a bunch of different sounds together and make it into a different language
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
