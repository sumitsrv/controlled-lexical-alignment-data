A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: _do_ _you_ _have a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _the_ _flower is_ [a] violet one 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on [a] theory . why does [the] _lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [do] ! _i_ [have] had _some_ [lotus] plants growing at home for _years ._ there's [a] lot [to] know when [you] get into plants _. i_ 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, it's_ not research ! _just_ [a] personal theory [. i] think _that_ [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ revealing _of_ personality than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [more] [of] an apple _person_ [, it's] _what_ [i] grew _as_ [a] kid growing up , [i] [have a] lot [of] family [that] [are] orchids 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . [as] if [you] drew "flower" with [a] crayon _and_ then _it_ came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] love flowers , [i] [have] three [of] _them_ actually [. i] [just] [like] [the] _pretty_ little red [and] white ones , [it] makes me feel peaceful 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone [what] their favourite [flower is] . [pretty] much [like] [what] we [just] did . does [that] make sense so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [just] love flowers in general really . 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk with [the] [person] [some] [more] , [and] ask [them] [some] [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] _they're_ [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five [years .] [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [it's] great [that] [you] [like] flowers , [they're] beautiful [and] [have] great life-blood
