Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 The flower is a violet one
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I do! I have had some Lotus plants growing at home for years. There's a lot to know when you get into plants. I
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I'm more of an apple person, it's what I grew as a kid growing up, I have a lot of family that are orchids
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 I love flowers, I have three of them actually. I just like the pretty little red and white ones, it makes me feel peaceful
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I just love flowers in general really.
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 It's great that you like flowers, they're beautiful and have great life-blood
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
