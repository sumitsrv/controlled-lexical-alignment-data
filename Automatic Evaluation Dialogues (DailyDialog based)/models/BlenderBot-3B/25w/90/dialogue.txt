Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I would love that! I played badminton for 8 years and I would love to show them my tennis skills!
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 Are you the captain of a sports team, or are just some random guy that would like to be a volunteer for one?
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 I don't know, I think I'll wait for the real event but it sounds fun, what are you doing that weekend
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I played badminton too and it was always a lot of fun. I was the best player by far on my team, but I was also
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 I think I will wait for the real event as well. We have been training for this one for months. 
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 The event will be this Saturday and the tickets have been sold out a long time ago.
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 That is amazing.  I hope you have a great time.  Are you doing the indoor or outdoor one? 
Human 1:	 Thanks.
