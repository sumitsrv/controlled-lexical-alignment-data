Human 2:	 Hi. This is a pleasant surprise.
Human 1:	 Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?
Human 2:	 It was very sweet but I think he is the only one who gets me presents for birthdays.
Human 1:	 Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.
Human 2:	 I love it. I was very surprised to find myself wrapped up in a nice box the morning before.
Human 1:	 Yes
Human 2:	 You don't have to ask him. You know he's gonna say yes.
Human 1:	 Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.
Human 2:	 I love warm beaches in the fall, that sounds like a really good idea. You have any holidays or plans?
Human 1:	 Mauii...Hope I like it too. Never been there before.
Human 2:	 I am going there in the next few weeks with some other family. Have you ever been?
Human 1:	 Awesome! Thanks for the tip.
