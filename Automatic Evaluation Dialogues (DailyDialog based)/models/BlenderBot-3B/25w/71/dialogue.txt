Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Good, just finished getting ready for work.
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 I know, right?  I was waiting for a package to show up all day, and it never showed up.  I was ready to tear
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm going to cry for you! That is awful. What project?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I would say that to anyone who got something that they waited for, no matter the reason.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 My dog, I was so angry about it!  She was sick and we didn't go to the vet because I was working so hard on
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry you lost your doggie. I'm trying out that diet too. It's been good so far!
