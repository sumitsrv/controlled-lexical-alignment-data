Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 Hello, my week is going good. I'm going to make some croissants this weekend for my wife and I.
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I'm making some chocolate chip cookies. They're my favorite kind!
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I'm good thanks! I've been cooking all week, I like baking so I've been experimenting with cookies
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I've been making chocolate chip cookies as well. I'm obsessed with them now!
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I love desserts as much as the next person I love sweets and cookies all day.
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I do too.  Some people don't really know what sweet tooth really means.  The term comes from Latin and means "s
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
