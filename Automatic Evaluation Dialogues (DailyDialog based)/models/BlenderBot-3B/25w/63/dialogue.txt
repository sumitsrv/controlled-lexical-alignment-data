Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Oh you bet! Maybe we can go together. Do you have any plans?
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 We have never been there and would really love to go! We're thinking we might do both days, since it's only a three day trip.
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 I love the idea! It will be great to have the family for the whole trip.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 We might do that. We might not. We're not sure yet though. We haven't talked much about plans for the weekend but we will soon
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I think that would work, but you will definitely need to be prepared for the traffic and it can get a little backed up in the morning rush
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 yea it seems to be a nice thing for you to do to help out and make someones life easy
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 We are getting her a new Nintendo Switch, it will keep her entertained for the time being
