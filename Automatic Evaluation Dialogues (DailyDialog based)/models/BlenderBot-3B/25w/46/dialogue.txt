Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 What kind of scenario?
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I can understand that.  But they might need help and I have to take their side.  What's the scenario?
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 Some of his old friends were mean to me and are still upset we have a falling out even though they used to like me
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 That would be difficult, but the best thing to do is take a stand for yourself and hope they come around!
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 I understand that it's hard but you have to think about who is better off in the end.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I can understand.  I would say you are correct.  I don't have anything to hide but still get the feeling like I am going to
