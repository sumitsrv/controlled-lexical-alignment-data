Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Good, I have been busy with school, my teacher has made it very demanding
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 Do you not get sick much? I was sick for three weeks a few months ago. My doctor just said to stay home and rest.
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I feel you. I just got over the flu this week and i'm feeling so lethargic it took me a week to get back to work
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 No, I have gotten a few colds this year, but I am hoping I am healthy for the Holidays!
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I have been sick all year long, I got the stomach bugs this time though so it really put a damper on all of my plans. 
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I love the beach! I'm going to have a lot of sunscreen. It is a desert!
