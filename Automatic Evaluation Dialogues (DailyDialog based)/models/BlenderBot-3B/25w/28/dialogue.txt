Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I ate breakfast this morning also, just some eggs and a yogurt.
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I had a nice breakfast as well but it was a healthier one.  I had toast and eggs.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I'd probably eat a lot of meat and cheese if I had to choose.
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I love my eggs and toast! But I would go for the steak and orange juice. Mmm...
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I love those complete foods too but the price is a bit steep and you only get one serving!
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I love a good meal too and a lot of meat and dairy products. I love eggs too much. 
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
