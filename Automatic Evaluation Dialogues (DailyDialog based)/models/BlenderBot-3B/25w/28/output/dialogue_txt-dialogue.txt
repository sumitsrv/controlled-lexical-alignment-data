B|7| Human 2: i'd probably [eat] [a] lot _of_ meat [and] cheese [if] [i had] _to_ choose . 
A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning _orange_ _would_ be [a] drawback ! that turns _my_ mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly want [to] say soylent or [one] [of] _those_ other "complete foods" , which [i] think defeats _the_ purpose [of] _the_ question . i'm in [a] muddle ! 
B|9| Human 2: _i love_ [my] [eggs and] toast ! but [i] [would] go for [the] steak [and] [orange] juice . mmm ...
