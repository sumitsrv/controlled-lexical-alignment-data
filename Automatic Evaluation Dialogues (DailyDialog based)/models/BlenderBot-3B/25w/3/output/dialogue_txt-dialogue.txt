B|5| Human 2: [it] rained _here_ [too] ! my poor dog got so wet , he can't go outside and get [the] wet fur off . [the] sun _was_ very bright 
A|6| Human 1: _where_ [i] grew up , _we_ had lots _of_ _water_ trouble [too] ... 
B|7| Human 2: that's [too] [bad] . [i] hate [it] when [it] _rains_ . 
A|8| Human 1: haha ... _i don't think_ [i] can survive _in_ _that_ weather ever . _just_ [the] [rains] at 50 degrees make me want to sit _in_ heated rroms 
B|9| Human 2: [i] understand . [it] [is] so hot _here_ [that the] temp has been rising all week and [it] feels [like] summer has [just] [started] .
