Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 I think it rained all night, it was very frigid
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 It rained here too! My poor dog got so wet, he can't go outside and get the wet fur off. The sun was very bright
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 That's too bad. I hate it when it rains.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 I understand. It is so hot here that the temp has been rising all week and it feels like summer has just started. 
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I feel you on that. I have a dog and he always needs water in the summertime so I don't think I'll be going anywhere anytime
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 I don't think a drought is the same here in Canada where people are getting worried about it, but we are getting a LOT of storms
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
