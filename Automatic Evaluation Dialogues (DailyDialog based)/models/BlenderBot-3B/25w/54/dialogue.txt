Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty good. I just got back from a nice day at the river!
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I just won a game of ping pong! I'm really excited that I am going to get a shiny new trophy!
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I like ping pong as well as the game of billiards!  I'm really, really bad at it, but I play it
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I like both billiards, ping pong and table tennis, as well as football and table tennis. Do you play
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 It's a team sport with a cue stick and ball, and you have to hit the opposite side of the net to score points. I suck
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 I don't play it, I wish I did though. I think it's such a fun sport to play and watch!
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
