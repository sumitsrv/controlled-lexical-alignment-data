Human 1:	 watermelon
Human 2:	 Watermelon and lemon? That was the first thing that came in mind when I read the title.
Human 1:	 I see. Yeah some are pretty strange
Human 2:	 Good to know that!
Human 1:	 lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird
Human 2:	 Oh no lol. That sounds nasty.   I don't like fruit too much. I prefer chocolate ice cream.
Human 1:	 that sounds pretty tasty actually
Human 2:	 Word that's cool. It was more like sour orange with a little melon flavor that was weird to eat.
Human 1:	 do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place
Human 2:	 I'm always down for some ice cream.
Human 1:	 lol
Human 2:	 Well I love it I'm a fan of it, but I don't think I'll be picking it up lol
