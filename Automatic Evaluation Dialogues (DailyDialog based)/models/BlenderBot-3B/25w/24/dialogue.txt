Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey there
Human 1:	 hey anything new?
Human 2:	 Hello! Not much new to report. I will be taking my dog to the veterinarian after being out of the office for awhile.
Human 1:	 any plans?
Human 2:	 I don't yet have plans. How old is your dog?
Human 1:	 that's awesome! I never been!
Human 2:	 No plans for now. But I am sure my dog will think something new is up when we get there
Human 1:	 Are you a food person, a sightseeing person or neither?
Human 2:	 I am definitely a food person but it's been raining so much that I may not have time to even go out and get any
Human 1:	 I'm a food person I think. Any specific foods you're planning on trying?
Human 2:	 I think I may just eat a whole load of food to try some of that traditional Chinese food.
Human 1:	 yeah my favorite is taco fish
Human 2:	 I'm both I think. I love trying new stuff! What is your favorite kind of food?
Human 1:	 no. only eat them 😀
