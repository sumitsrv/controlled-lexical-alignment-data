Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 Hello! Good, the food is always good in the microkitchen. They are the best.
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 Yes! I am so happy for a free jacket. I needed one as it's cold in the house!
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 I know! I get cold too! But it was a good thing that I didn't need it!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 It was so cold I had to wear my ski jacket! It didn't even occur to me that my house was that cold, I thought
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live in Victoria, Australia. Cold can be tough for us because of the altitude, but at least I will be home
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 It's still really cold here right now. I am freezing my tits off! I need to get the heating on!
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 It's getting late but I still have to get out the front door to go walk the dogs before they go to bed. I don't want to
