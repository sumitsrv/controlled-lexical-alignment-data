Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	 I don't know yet. Just going to see who wants to come to my house really so we can eat all of the food.
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	 Kale is like my jam. I love making kale chips
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	 No Kale. They used to put kale in our lunches at school as a vegetable. It was not bad but I never ate
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	 I really like computers I love that they are so versatile.
Human 1:	 Yes!
Human 2:	 Yes? I love computers too! I was always so jealous of my brother that he could code on them and I could not.
Human 1:	 lol
