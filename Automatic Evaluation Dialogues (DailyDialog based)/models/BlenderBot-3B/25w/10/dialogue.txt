Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Its going good so far, its a nice sunny day in my area. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	 Its going well, thank you for asking.
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	 The civil war actually started on May 17th, 1861!
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 No we actually didn't learn about the civil war in school, I know we covered it in a lot of detail, but nothing on Columbus
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	 That's correct.  I'm studying history!  I actually have a test next Friday, actually!
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 I was born one, what about you?
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	 I was born one! Are you?  What do you think of it?
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	 Yeah I have been horse since I was 4. Its very fun and you get to work with horses 24 hrs a day!
