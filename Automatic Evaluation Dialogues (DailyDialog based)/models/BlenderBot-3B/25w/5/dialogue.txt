Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I am sad, as well. Cherish the memories of her! :)
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 It's a rough day..I've just come to feel bad for her and miss my cat. I think the whole family is missing each other
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would like to go to Japan and visit Kyoto, Japan.  I love the culture and the architecture there.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to go to a lot of places really! Maybe the Himalayas, Japan or Thailand.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I think that would be a cool place to visit.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I think it sounds cool too.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 Oh yeah.  I'm a bit scared of heights but ziplining sounds like a lot of fun..
