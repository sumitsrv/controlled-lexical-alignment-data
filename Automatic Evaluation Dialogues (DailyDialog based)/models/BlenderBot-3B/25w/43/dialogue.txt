Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 Hello! I sure am.
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 Yea I will menter this year but we are not sure of the structure of the mentorship.
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 I'm a mentor of the youth group, this is the first time I've really mentored kids since leaving school
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 It certainly is.  Have you learned anything new about them since you started that 1:1 session?
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 Well this is actually their first summer program for them to go to. I want to make sure I am a positive mentor this time!
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 I'm really looking forward to working with them this summer, I think it will be very beneficial
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
