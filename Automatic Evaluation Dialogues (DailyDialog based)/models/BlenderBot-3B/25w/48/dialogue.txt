Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good. How are you doing today?
Human 2:	 I'm doing fine thank you. Just watching tv and enjoying some good old fashioned rain
Human 1:	 I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?
Human 2:	 I had a big lunch the day I met up with my friend from my old workplace the other day.
Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	 I was out fishing today, and caught a fish that was about 10 inches long.  It made me very happy
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?
Human 2:	 I love to hear that. Yes it was hard for me to catch such a big fish
Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	 I have before and it's always fun.  Did you catch any fish on the fly?
Human 1:	 haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?
Human 2:	 Yes I have, fishing is so peaceful, I love the time you get to spend with friends!
Human 1:	 Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?
Human 2:	 Yes, I love it! My family is really into the outdoors. I have been fishing many times, especially when we would camp in
