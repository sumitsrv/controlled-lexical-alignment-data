Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	 Good, just got done watching the walking dead.
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	 I do have good plans for the weekend! I have to visit a friend in Florida.
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 I'm a pretty grateful for my health, especially after the holidays and this time of year. I can't wait to get out
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 I'm going to a conference for business administration, it is for a client I've been working with the last while.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 Yeah, that's the same one! It's in Tampa. I hope you have a great vacation!
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It's one of the larger ones this weekend in Chicago with 100,000 people. It's pretty cool that you get to do something like that on
