A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: what do _you_ _think_ about _human like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ prefer [human like chat bots] , they're always _so_ eager _to_ help me , _so_ _nice_ ! 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed [to] _have_ _made_ some _great progress_ over last few years . do _you_ _think the_ positives _outweigh_ _the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: yes , [the] [great progress] _has_ been [made] . it's _very_ much [like] _a_ [chat] bot in [the] sense _that_ _it can_ communicate , _and_ _i think_ _that_ 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though [it] sounds _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ _they_ [have] [the] potential [to] [outweigh] all _of_ [the negatives] if [we] _can_ improve [the] quality _and_ efficiency _of_ them . 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! some [of] these [bots] _are very_ engaging [and] funny . _they are_ now good at even sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ _are_ [we] from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: yes [and] _as a_ chatbot , [they are] designed [to] _be_ user friendly [and] easy [to] use 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it can] take many different forms [as a] product . [the] research implication _is_ also huge ! _it will_ signify _how_ _ai_ research [has] progressed [so] _far_ [and] better place [to] tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i] can't wait [to] see [how far] [they] go . [it will] change [the] way [we] communicate ! especially _with_ social media [and] online marketing where [the] quality 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: yeah [that] would [be] [a] [great] way [to] improve things , but [i] don't [think the] [ai] [will] [be] [that] advanced in [the] near future . 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 [nice] having this conversation [with] _you_ ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that] [is] [great] news ! [i think] [you] [are very] optimistic .
