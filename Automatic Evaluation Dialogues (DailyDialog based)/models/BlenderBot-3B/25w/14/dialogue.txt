Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	 Hello! I am well. Just getting a break before class. I start work at the mall after. You?
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	 I'm just hanging out right now and listening to my music. I'm having a good day. I can't wait to get to the beach
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 I am doing well and trying to relax as well. Did you go in the water with that roller coaster?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I love roller coasters! But I've never been on any of the big ones, like Space Mountain or Steel Venge
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 I haven't, but I'm pretty sure that's a roller coaster in an amusement park near you, right? I'm not
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I would say so. I love roller coaster rides and would go on a big one any time I could as we don't get any
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 I was not much of an adrenaline junkie when I was younger but I did try it. I remember the big ones that were really
