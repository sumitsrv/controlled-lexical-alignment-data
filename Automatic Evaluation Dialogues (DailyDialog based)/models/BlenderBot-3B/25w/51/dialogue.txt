Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It has been okay, my car broke down, so I had to make my way home to fix it
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been quite a while.  I'm about to put on some good memories on the radio and have a little party
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I love horse racing! It's been about 5 years since I've had a day like that. Have you been in one before?
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I did once when I was younger for a family gathering but they aren't into it anymore.
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I've never been in one but I would love to, that would be very much fun.  
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I am so not the kind of person who likes the city so I rarely go. I like the countryside far more
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I've been to New York, but only once. I'd love to go back and explore the city more though. What about you where would you
