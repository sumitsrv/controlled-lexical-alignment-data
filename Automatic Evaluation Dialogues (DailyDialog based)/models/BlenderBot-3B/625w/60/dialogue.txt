Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's good!  I am so excited to get some new makeup.
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was the weekend. How can you not feel good about yourself rock climbing?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was the movie about a climbing rock. So good. What's your favorite kind of makeup
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 It was the movie that just came out yesterday and the one about a rock climbing accident. What kind of twists and turns did they have over
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 the movie about a little rock climbing was when saw it but that's all they can be and fun runs are nice
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I've not seen it but that was a very good question and you are so right it can get scary when its dark out like that.
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I'd like it too but not as much as the southern lights from here in Australia
