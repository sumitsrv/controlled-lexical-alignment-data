Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 It's a good memory you have the name Sarah. I don't recall meeting you before?
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 Hey, that's right! I met you the day I was in a dance studio with your mother, she asked me why I wanted to do
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 Lol, you met schwasty the Italian plumber?  He lives in a mansion right?  Were you there when he
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure. You probably don't know him.  I have a private practice either.  It's in Los Altos
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I know you have the best practice in that area. Were you not sure what I did there though?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you did but that's cool that you have a job that's private.
