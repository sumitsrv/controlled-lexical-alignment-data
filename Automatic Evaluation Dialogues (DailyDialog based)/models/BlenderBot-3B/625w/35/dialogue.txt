Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I'm well today! I've got a lot of sleep left
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I know that all too well, working night shifts is such a drag.  Why was it sleepy today?
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm gonna get a job working night shift at a hospital today
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I'm actually still in high school, but was working night shifts all night
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I love surgeon school! How do you plan on going about applying?
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 I think so too actually! My friend recently became a brain surgeon!
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 I think you can practice that with medical school but I'm afraid I have no clue how.
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I was born with that ability, you have to try though. I thought about becoming a brain surgeon for a while but decided against it, it
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 Maybe with the brain surgeon you have to try and do that for a little while but I don't think I can even aim for school, its
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
