Human 1:	 Should be very sunny! you?
Human 2:	 I might do some hiking. My friends are going to a very beautiful and sunny weekend this weekend.
Human 1:	 😐 hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!
Human 2:	 I might get the laundry done or work on some free time, you are getting very close to your weekend. Have you planned anything?
Human 1:	 I am going to Diablo!
Human 2:	 Nope, you are going soon? I'm very jealous. I hope you get to see a lot of nice scenery!
Human 1:	 hours drive from here. still in bay area
Human 2:	 I hope you have fun on your weekend! I'll get there soon. I just want to take this drive in the cool breeze and sun
Human 1:	  Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.
Human 2:	 that will take a day for sure. I love the drive here though. but you need your gas money
