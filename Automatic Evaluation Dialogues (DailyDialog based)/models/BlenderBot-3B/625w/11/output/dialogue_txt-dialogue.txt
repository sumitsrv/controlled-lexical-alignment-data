A|0| Human 1: _hi_ ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [hi] , no , [have] [you] ever seen _the_ [flower] _that_ _is_ called [a] pepermint ? 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on [a] theory . why does _the lotus_ _spring_ _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] _not_ , [the lotus] _flower is_ [a] long legged plant _with a_ taproot in [spring] 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's not_ research ! _just_ [a] personal theory _. _i_ think_ [that] [flower] preferences _are_ _more_ revealing of personality than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [the lotus] [flower] [that] [people] [are] drawn [to] _. [it's_ not] my [favourite] - [have] [you] seen _it_ in real _life_ ? 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera [. it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if [you] drew "flower" [with a] crayon _and_ then [it] came [to] [life] . 
B|9| Human 2: [it's not] [that] [i] [like] [it] but [the] [flower] [lotus] [that] [you] [are] talking about _is_ geronimo [. i] [have] seen [a] lot 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what _their_ [favourite] [flower is] . _pretty_ much [like] what we _just_ _did_ . does [that] _make_ sense _so_ far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [like] [flower] [that] [are] [not] [just] for [their] [pretty] leaves , but also [the] life's meaning too . but [you] [make] [a] good point 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] [the] person _some_ _more_ , _and_ ask _them_ _some_ _more_ questions , _and_ gradually develop [a] sense of what _they're_ [like] , over [the] course of maybe two [to] five years . _and_ voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [did] [some] [flower] gardening [the] other day [and] [they're] [just] [so] beautiful . [lotus] [are] [a] great way [to] [make] [them] [more] v 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , that's [a] wonderful idea !
