Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Hi, no, have you ever seen the flower that is called a pepermint?
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I have not, the lotus flower is a long legged plant with a taproot in spring
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I think it's the lotus flower that people are drawn to. It's not my favourite - have you seen it in real life?
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 It's not that I like it but the flower lotus that you are talking about is geronimo. I have seen a lot
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I like flower that are not just for their pretty leaves, but also the life's meaning too. But you make a good point
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 I did some flower gardening the other day and they're just so beautiful. Lotus are a great way to make them more v
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
