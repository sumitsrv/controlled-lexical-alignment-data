Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 It raining today. That makes me pretty mad to be honest. 
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Its raining like crazy, the air is a mess too
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 It rained pretty much the whole days this year! I don't like that too
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 that weather can make the water run down like this too much, especially rains that don't move quickly
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I have the water supply but that still doesn't make this rain any less scary.
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 that must have been crazy this morning, i was here the whole rain too
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
