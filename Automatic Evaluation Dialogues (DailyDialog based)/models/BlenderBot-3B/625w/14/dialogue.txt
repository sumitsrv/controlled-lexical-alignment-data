Human 2:	 I am doing ok today, how are you and that coaster?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I am sorry, what was that coaster called?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 I am not that's crazy! but you sound brave and that was cool! Kingda Ka was the first coaster I ever went on
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I'm not that but roller coaster are the coolest adrenaline rider and you actually went to six flags with a friend
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 I wasn't but the adrenaline got me. Maybe because it wasn't that tall and not as much coaster as I was expecting.
