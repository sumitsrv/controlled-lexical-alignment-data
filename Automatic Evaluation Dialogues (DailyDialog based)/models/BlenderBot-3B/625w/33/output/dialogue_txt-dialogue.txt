A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great_ , _thanks ._ _i'm_ trying to learn how to _make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thanks .] [it's] raining here in _the_ uk _so_ _i_ _have_ [croissants] on _the_ menu for tea later ! 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ once or twice [so] far , _but they_ haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm] trying to figure _out_ why . what _kind of_ _cookies_ [have] _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [croissants] [out] [of] [flakey] [but they] are [kind of] _a_ hit _and_ miss _when_ [you] [make] [them] . [it's] [been] [great] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks !_ 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thanks !] _it_ _is_ raining here _as_ well [but] [good] thing _i_ [have] my umbrella ! _i_ [make] chocolate chip [cookies] 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ [is] [a] [good] idea . i'll give [it] [a] _try_ _next time_ . would [you] say [you] [have] [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [cookies] [that] [you] toast _and_ [make] [sweet] [croissants] [out] [of] [them] , [try] [flakey] ones [next time] 
A|10| Human 1: some people don't ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , [i] _think_ i'd _eat_ pastries _all_ [the] [time] if _i could_ get away _with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [have] definitely [made] those [too] . [it's] [the] best [of] both [the] [croissants] [you] [eat] [with] your hands _and_ [sweet] toasted [cookies] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention to [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ [when] <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed [as] [a] fat substitute , [and] caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [have] [the] [sweet tooth] [of] [a] teenage girl [that] [was] just eaten [out] [of] [the] blue [and] [all] [i could] [think] about [was] stuffed past 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need to enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
