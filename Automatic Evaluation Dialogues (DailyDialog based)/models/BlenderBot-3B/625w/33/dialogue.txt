Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks. It's raining here in the UK so I have croissants on the menu for tea later!
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I have made croissants out of flakey but they are kind of a hit and miss when you make them. It's been great
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks! It is raining here as well but good thing I have my umbrella! I make chocolate chip cookies
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I have made cookies that you toast and make sweet croissants out of them, try flakey ones next time
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I have definitely made those too. It's the best of both the croissants you eat with your hands and sweet toasted cookies
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I have the sweet tooth of a teenage girl that was just eaten out of the blue and all I could think about was stuffed past
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
