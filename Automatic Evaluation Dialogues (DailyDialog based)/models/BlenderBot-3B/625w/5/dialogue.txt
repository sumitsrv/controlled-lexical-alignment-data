Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad about what?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I'm great, how about you? Posters and catfood dish banging?
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would love to go to where the great ones of the past are living and visit some catfood factories.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love there be some canasters from my youths and the rainforest are great
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I'm scared too! I would love to go somewhere where there are now catfoods and zipline!
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I heard there are one in southeast Asia and in Mexico too. 
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 Well then you should and invent one, zipline tourism is about to make you so much money
