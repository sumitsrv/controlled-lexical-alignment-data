Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Good day just got back from playing basketball with my friends. How about your's?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 I work the weekend. I don't want to though.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 My day's going pretty well. I get to watch the game live, you lucky bugger
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 What are you going to watch today? Are you the sharks? How violent can a baseball game really be? Haha
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 UFC will actually be coming on tonight at 8 pm like the other day too so this weekend might be fun haha. Are you going to watch
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I have been out and about the past couple weekends, but there's a UFC event this weekend? It might have to wait a little longer
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah I will watch and give it a try
