Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Not much! Just trying to study and do well in exams. And you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 Nothing much, was just thinking the last time was like this friend was like 5 years ago and I was like wow we are really you going to do
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 Oh it was awkward the last time I saw him. He had been in jail for like a long time. 
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh wow that was really long ago! Has it been a long time?
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Ohh okay. A lot of life changes for sure but it sounds like you had a really fun time.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 A long time indeed. Bull riding would really fun for your life but it was pretty scary for my friend. you have any hobbies that sounds exciting
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 that does interest me but I never have time, my life it pretty bland like you say
