Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 It is going okay
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I've been okay. Just reading and writing papers too. Today isn't going so well. Hows your day been?
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I sometimes see things as well. and it mostly has been papers and docs. what kind of work you doing?
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 I work as a social media consultant and love the work.
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would be going to work and writing all day
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 that would be so neat, i just like diving with dive buddies and going places you cannot see with your eyes so i don't have
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 That's too bad because you can just see the world with your eyes when your body is underwater! It would be amazing to explore all that
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 That's too bad.. that must be expensive with all the money you would have to spend just to get your breathing supplies. It can't
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
