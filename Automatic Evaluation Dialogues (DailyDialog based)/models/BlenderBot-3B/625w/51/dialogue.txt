Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's going good, I spent most of the day watching the Cubs game, but the weather is bad. How about yourself?
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been great, my friends actually had some good plans to go horseback riding but we were all busy watching soccer haha. How about you
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 It's been great so far. I'm glad that we had a good weather day before the fishing, since I wouldn't have enjoyed going for
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I had been thinking about going fishing for some weekend! Have you got plans? It's good that you like the horseback riding.
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I'm going fishing too, been thinking about it since its very deep sea with a tropical setting. Have you had it before?
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I like fishing but I think you'd have fun there because the weather is nice
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I've never been fishing but have always wanted to some time, the city itself seems like an interesting place to visit because there's so much going
