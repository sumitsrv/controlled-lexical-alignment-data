Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 Hey! the concepts are not hard to understand you will be fine!
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	 Yes you have time! I think the last slides are out now
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 I think I have a pretty good understanding of the concepts for this class. I was able to preparation plenty well going into test week,
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 Good think I have plenty time for that. But the problem is how do i not get stressed out over this test since its so close now.
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 Its going pretty well so far! This time the test will not be over for like another week though! 
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 that is pretty good though you will have time still for the weekend so your not overloaded with coursework, like I was this week.
