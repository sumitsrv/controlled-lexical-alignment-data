Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 Are you pondering any scenario in particular or just need help with anything in general?
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I have been pondering the same scenario for awhile now and they are all good friend's with benefits
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 I hope they all have their reasons for not inviting you like the friendship faded out between you and them with their other friends or someone's
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 AKA the ponderings are for all types. But I hope they do not take advantage of you like they have been with everyone else
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 It's always for all reasons but it's never the good ones. I hope that you find friends too, they are important.
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I hope the same for you. It's all about balance that's what is good for you, everyone deserves it but not everyone does the same
