Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 What would you do if you lived on an island and one of the only things to eat was Asian Food?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 I think I would too, Asian Food can be so healthy but can get you so full. What's your favorite ice cream? 
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 That would be the ice cream and you?
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 That would nice, vanilla ice cream is like the classic and one of my top favorite too! It's sooo smooth and sweet I love chocolate
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 I think there's something afterlife, the world is too nice and peaceful to be true.  I love chocolate ice cream too. Mint
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 What are you most excited about seeing afterlife wise?  I feel the same way.
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
