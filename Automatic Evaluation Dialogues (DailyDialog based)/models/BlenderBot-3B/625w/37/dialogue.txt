Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking! What game you meeting friends for?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm so glad you are meeting friends soon for a game! I prefer to play with friends. It's so fun.
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I would prefer to play with a group but I'm thinking about getting my own and learning for exercise so you can do some solo exercises too
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I recommend you get it if you like gaming and getting exercise. It's fun but also for parties and social events.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I just finished the book called Switch for the nth time it's like a fun adventure read.  It's set in Oregon
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 Patrick O'Brien's book is good but you are the first person I have ever hear talk about it. What are you doing on
