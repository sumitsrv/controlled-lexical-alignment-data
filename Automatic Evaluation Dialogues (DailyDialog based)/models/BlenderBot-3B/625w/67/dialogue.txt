Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I'm great! That will be scary for sure. Are you ready?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm ready to get on a plane! Seville is a great place for skydiving, I've heard
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 Yes I have done before but I'm getting ready for my next one. Have you skydiving before? 
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I'm ready for you to feel that way! I tried skydiving before but never made it over the ground. Have you done any extreme sports
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I would love to try it, I'm afraid that my wife will not be too keen on it.  Have you tried any sports before?
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I once skydived for the fun of it. But I'm not very good and that was before any of my medical issues.
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
