Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good. How are you doing today?
Human 2:	 I'm doing good, just finished my daily walks today. How are you?
Human 1:	 I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?
Human 2:	 I'm doing good today! I was the first one to have lunch in my family for the week! How are you doing? What did you have
Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	 I love seafood especially shellfish, and I had some great sea urchins for lunch today. How was the kite flying?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?
Human 2:	 I love kite flying. It was hard for you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	 I have before. Have you done this yourself?
Human 1:	 haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?
Human 2:	 Nope this was the first time but I'm really hoping to have done before. I thought kite fishing sounded like fun.
Human 1:	 Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?
Human 2:	 I have done fishing several times before. I like the outdoors.
