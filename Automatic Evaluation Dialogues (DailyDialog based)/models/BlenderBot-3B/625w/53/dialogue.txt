Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty busy.  I work in the medical field.
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 Just work for the most part, trying to finish up projects before the break that I have due to arrive.
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Well that's fun for you. I like to have fun before the break. I want to have fun with my family before Thanksgiving dinner.
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I've started getting a bit fit the past couple of months trying to get ready for the holidays. Just like you though, not long before
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I like to have fun as well, just not when the break is coming up! I've started to go for long walks though. Do you
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I started running long walks in the morning, just for fun. It started off as 30 minutes before work, and gradually worked my way up
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I've started running every morning for fun as well. Not long though.
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 I have one more marathon, this year, to run.
