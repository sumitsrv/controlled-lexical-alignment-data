Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	 good you are not the only thankful for holidays especially coming out Thanksgiving!
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	 My Thanksgiving plans are have you been good for the holidays? How about yours?
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 It's cold here too, thankfully we have good AC though so I can stay as warm as I want for Christmas. I really hope you are
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 It's for a conference called the National Science Festival in Canada that has really good food.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 It was for the Japanese Festival in Las Vegas and it was a good time. 
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It's for the Young Americans for Liberty!  I was really into it last year and attend all the time.
