Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 Yeah you are a rockstar! What sort of guitar are you playing this week?
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 Just got the guitar for Christmas and it took me months to learn some barre chords. 
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 That's cool. It's like the alphabets for chords in music. I can play guitar but still have some time to learn them much
