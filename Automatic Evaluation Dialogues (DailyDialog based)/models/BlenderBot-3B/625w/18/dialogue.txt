Human 1:	 oh no, which areas will be affected?
Human 2:	 I'm too. It will be pretty bad here. It's the same weather today which was reported to be the worst hurricane ever.
Human 1:	 uh oh, I'd better not to plan for BBQ then instead just enjoying playing board games inside 🙂
Human 2:	 I'm just enjoying playing board games inside too, better here then down south for the worst weather.
Human 1:	 yea, you'd better check. where do you live?
Human 2:	 I live in Texas for the moment. you?
Human 1:	 gotcha. anything you love about where you live?
