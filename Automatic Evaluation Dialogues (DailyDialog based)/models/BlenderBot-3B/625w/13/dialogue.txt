Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I saw it a while ago. The one in Paris with Ryan Gosling and Madeleine Stowe
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?

Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha

Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I think that the movie was really good, and I've seen only Spiderman too. The movies don't hold a candle to that one
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I think the movies are scary too, that was before I really heard of Lindsey Stirling. She only joined Marvel in 2009
