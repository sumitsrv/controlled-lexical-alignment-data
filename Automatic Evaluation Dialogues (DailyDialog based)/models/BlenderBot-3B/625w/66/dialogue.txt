Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 Hi! It went really well! It took me two hours because I wasn't very fast, so I'm very happy.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 I think so, I need to see if the marathon coming up is in town this year.  I haven't run any events in months
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 Are you doing the Spartan marathon in March? It's a race to see which one of the over 200 nation's triath
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 It's actually fun doing Spartan race events like the obstacles and cross country and triathlons which are not overtly
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 I haven't heard about that one but for the last few months I've gone and obstacle raceing. It's fun doing races like that
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 Sounds like a good time, I would love to workout and race the Spartan race one day which is an obstacle course race for
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 Spartan training can be good for the youth with their obstacles which I bet Monterey has fun one
