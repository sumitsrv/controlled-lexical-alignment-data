A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think_ _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! [what] [about] [you] ? _are_ [you] [human] ? 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have made_ _some_ _great progress over_ last few _years_ . do [you] _think_ _the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: _i think_ _they_ [have made] [great progress over] [the] [years] , _some of_ [the] [chat bots] _can_ actually outperform [human] interpreters . 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? _though_ _it_ _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ impsorsination [like] [the] [bots] _that_ [you] [chat] _with_ [over] video [chat] _is_ [great] for [some] but _it can_ get out _of_ control , especially 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! [some of] these [bots] [are] _very_ engaging _and_ funny . [they] [are] _now_ _good_ at _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder _how far_ [are] _we_ _from the_ time these [bots] _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [have] had [very] [good] impersonation calls [from the] [bots] [that] [are] [made] by chatting [and] _i think_ [some] [like] [the] [human] voice [over] [even] [though] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it _can] take_ many different forms as a product _. the_ _research_ implication [is] _also_ huge ! [it] _will_ signify _how_ ai _research_ has progressed so _far_ [and] better place _to_ tackle _more_ futuristic _problems_ 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [bots] [will] [take] [over] [the] world one day [and] [even] [more] impersonation [problems] [are] [about] [to] [start] . 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions already do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the current] technology [now] [can] [even] differentiate [the] voice [and] [the] [sounds] [from the] environment around 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty _far_ fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [haha] [you] [are] right , [this] [can] [also] implicate [how far] [we] [can take] [the] future [with] [that] [research] [. the] [good] thing [about] [current] technology [and] bot
