Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	 Hello! What about you? Are you human?
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	 I think they have made great progress over the years, some of the chat bots can actually outperform human interpreters.
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	 I think impsorsination like the bots that you chat with over video chat is great for some but it can get out of control, especially
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 I have had very good impersonation calls from the bots that are made by chatting and I think some like the human voice over even though
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	 The bots will take over the world one day and even more impersonation problems are about to start.
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	 The current technology now can even differentiate the voice and the sounds from the environment around
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 haha you are right, this can also implicate how far we can take the future with that research. The good thing about current technology and bot
