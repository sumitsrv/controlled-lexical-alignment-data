Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Its going ok, but my mom just got back from her honeymoon
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 Oh no so sorry to hear that! How bad was the problem?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 The mechanic said the carbs were out and the engine was trying to overheat so he fixed that. But now it needs new tires.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Did you drive the moped to work today?  How far was your trip?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 That sounds good. Did you drive the moped today? No, that lasted for about 5 miles this morning.
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 That's good. Did you catch the Warriors game last night? The San Francisco Warriors, of course?
