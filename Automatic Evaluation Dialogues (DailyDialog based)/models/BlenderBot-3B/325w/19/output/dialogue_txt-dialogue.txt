B|3| Human 2: oh _my_ [! what] _a_ cool superhero [you] are . _my_ son _is_ [the] same way [about] his toys . 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . _you won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: that's too _bad_ [you won't see] him , [you] should show him [the] [invisible] man show so he _can_ [see] [you] . he will love _it_ 
A|6| Human 1: _i would_ rather _trust_ fmri _and_ _machine_ _learning_ [to] do this . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ [it] ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i would] [trust] [the] [machine] [that] _is_ [learning] , [and] [not] _a_ guy _in_ _a_ [superman] suit , _no_ offense . 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain_ imaging _thing_ [that] [can] tell _you a_ brain's activity at [a] _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [the brain] [thing] _is_ [pretty] cool [and] creepy 
A|10| Human 1: _i _believe_ in_ _science_ ! _science_ [is] [my] _god_ ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] [and] religion can't always coexist that's [for] sure . we [believe in] [the] same [thing] , we just [see] [the] world differently ! 
A|12| Human 1: [no] , _i'm_ [bad] at [science] . [what] [can] [science] do ? [is] [it] _the most important thing for_ society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [the] same way [! what] [you] said [about] [god] [and] [science] [i believe] [that] [for] [the most] part . [science] can't give [you a] 100% 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] think so . [it] [is] [the most important thing for] us [to] have [and] [make sense] of existence . [science] [can] explain everything [about] [it]
