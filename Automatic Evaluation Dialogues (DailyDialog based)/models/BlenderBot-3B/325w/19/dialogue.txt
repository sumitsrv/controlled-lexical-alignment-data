Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 Oh my! What a cool superhero you are. My son is the same way about his toys.
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 That's too bad you won't see him, You should show him the invisible man show so he can see you. He will love it
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 I would trust the machine that is learning, and not a guy in a superman suit, no offense.  
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 the brain thing is pretty cool and creepy
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 Science and religion can't always coexist that's for sure. We believe in the same thing, we just see the world differently!
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 I'm the same way! what you said about god and science I believe that for the most part. Science can't give you a 100%
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I think so. It is the most important thing for us to have and make sense of existence. Science can explain everything about it
