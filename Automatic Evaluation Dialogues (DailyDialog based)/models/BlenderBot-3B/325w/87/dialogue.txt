Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I have been studying hard so I don't have to do another assignment. you?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the great gatsby.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the great gatsby too! I love how it shows that you can sleep better knowing you have someone to share everything
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I'm reading The Grapes of Wrath, it's so good but I have to read like that the whole book in a week.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 it does seem like something Peter Thiel would read! I'm going to check that book out for sure.
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 I think the book sounds like it might make for good reading.  I also read that in Highschool and found it very interesting but was not sure
Human 1:	 yup!
