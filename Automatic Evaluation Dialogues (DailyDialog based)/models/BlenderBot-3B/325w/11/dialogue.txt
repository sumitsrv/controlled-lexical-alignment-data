Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Yes, it is a flower that I have found that grows at home, it is a white rose with a beautiful red petals.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I like the lotus flower. It's the plant that has white petals and blooms every spring. Do you have a favourite flower
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I think it's the flower that are more than 4 meteres tall that's beautiful.
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 Well lotus flowers are beautiful and I think it's the flower that people appreciate the most because you need to be so diligent
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I like just about all flowers. The lotus flower is gorgeous and it's the largest and most commonly grown in the world
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 that's what they make you think. the more the person who makes them like it the more they are appreciated. and some flower ger
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
