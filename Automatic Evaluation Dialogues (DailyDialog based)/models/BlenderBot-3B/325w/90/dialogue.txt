Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 Yes I would, I'd like to play for Google
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 What will you play? There's a badminton event for the Volunteers of the year award for outstanding volunteer work
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 Hi There!  I have participated in some events like volunteer sports and youth outreach before.  It's fun
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I volunteer for the Volunteers with a couple of other youth who are also participating in sports.
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 Oh well the youth outreach event sounds like fun. I have a few other volunteer events planned for next week so can't do
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 That would be great and a place for youths to volunteer to help with sports would be great because the are some events on sund
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 That's fine. you have already volunteered with the youth outreach event and can start organizing logistics next week. The need
Human 1:	 Thanks.
