A|4| Human 1: _whoa_ ! looking forward [to] listening [to] _it_ . _what_ softewares _you_ _use_ _for_ _it_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ am [going] [to] [use] _a_ soft [for] [video creation] , [what] [you] _do you_ make ? 
A|6| Human 1: oh cool ! [what] sort _of_ _music_ [do you] compose ? 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ am an aspiring musician , but _i_ have not had [the] _time_ [to] practice _for a_ while . [whoa] _, _you_ are_ making _a_ 
A|8| Human 1: _nice_ .... [you are] [a] _rockstar_ ! 😉 
B|9| Human 2: [nice] [are] [you] [going] [for] that [music] composition or [the] [rockstar] part ? _i_ _can_ make [music] .

A|12| Human 1: _yes_ , [the] bar _chords_ [are] [the] worst . [it] took me several months [to] _play them_ well . _i still can't play them_ [for a] long [time] though 
B|13| Human 2: [i still can't play them] yet [. just] [the] strumming [for] [chords] . but [yes] [i] _like the_ [guitar] and [this] will be [my first] [time] 
A|14| Human 1: that's true . _it's_ [like the] alphabets in [a] language . once _you know_ [them] [, _you] can_ _pretty much_ write word 
B|15| Human 2: [i play] [guitar] too ! [it's] [pretty much] [the] same concept [you know] [like] [chords] [you can] strum but [it's] [just] different [for] every song/
