Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I'm ready for one too!!! skydiving is the greatest
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm ready for a skydiving lesson too. Seville is beautiful.
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 I haven't done it before. Have you been skydiving before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I tried skydiving once, but I was so scared I'm scared to do it again for a while. You?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 Not since I was a little kid but that is definitely something I really want to do before I die. Have you ever done any extreme sports before?
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I tried once on the slope and was able to make it down very smoothly after that, but definitely scared that it was for a short amount
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
