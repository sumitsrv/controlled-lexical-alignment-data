Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good. How are you doing today?
Human 2:	 I'm good, you are doing well today? Any plans today?
Human 1:	 I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?
Human 2:	 I was thinking of having an egg and cheese sandwich for lunch today, have you ever had one?
Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	 I love seafood for lunch. How was the kite flying?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?
Human 2:	 It was hard flying my kite but I did it for the first time today
Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	 No I have not done that before. How hard was it?
Human 1:	 haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?
Human 2:	 Yes. I have fished before in other states. this was the first time I was going with just the kite itself.
Human 1:	 Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?
Human 2:	 No, I have not. I would consider you an expert outdoors person. What other things have you done before?
