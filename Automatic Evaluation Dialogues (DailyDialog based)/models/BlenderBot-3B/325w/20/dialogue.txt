Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 Stirfry would always be my first choice, you can prepare so much with it.
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 That's tough, since I love Asian too. But ice cream was my childhood and I would miss it, especially vanilla.
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 I think I would pick the pizza and any variations too.
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 Very nice.  Creamy chocolate and vanilla ice cream are the best.  But I love any variation on it.  How about
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 Yes, and the afterlife will be like the one of our world's ancestors. We all have been there once, as we have
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 What do you think about reincarnation? I believe in that too.
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
