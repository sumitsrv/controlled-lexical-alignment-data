A|0| Human 1: _hi !_ 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you_ _think_ _about_ _human_ _like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [hi !] [what] [about] [you] ? not much , just chatting _with_ _this_ bot _that_ _is_ named [human] . its been around since 1966 . 
A|4| Human 1: _yep ,_ we _seemed_ _to_ _have_ made _some great progress over_ _last few years ._ do [you] _think the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: [yep ,] [human] [chat bots] [have] [seemed] [like] [some great progress over] [the] [last few years .] 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though _it_ _sounds_ far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: well , i'm not _a_ bot . but [the] impersination _that_ [you] talk [about] [sounds] [like] an interesting concept . _i think it_ _might be_ _a_ [great] 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] _! some_ of these _bots _are_ very_ engaging _and_ _funny ._ they _are_ _now_ _good_ _at_ _even_ sarcasm [i] wonder how far _are_ we _from_ [the] _time_ these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: _i [think_ the] [bots] [and] [chat] _is_ [good] . [i] [have] [some] [that] [i] [like] [to] talk [to] [from] [time] [to] [time] . [some] [are very] clever [about] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think it] _can_ take many different forms as [a] product . _the research implication_ [is] also huge ! [it] will signify how ai _research_ has progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] [might be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: yeah [the] bot [can] learn [and] adapt [more] [now] too ! [the] future [is] [good] for sure 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions already do _pretty good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the current] [bots are] [great] [! some] [are] [even] [pretty good] [and] [can] [be] [funny .] [i] love [the research implication] . 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] far fetched 🙂 nice having [this] conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: [the] way [you] [are] looking [at] [this] makes [the] future seem [very] [good] indeed . [i] can't wait [to] use [it]
