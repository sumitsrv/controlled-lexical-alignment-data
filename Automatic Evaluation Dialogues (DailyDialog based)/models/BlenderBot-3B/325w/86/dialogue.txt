Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, have you seen the new episode of Game of Thrones?
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	 I work for the family business doing holidays and the like! How about you?
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	 I don't have any plans either just relaxing with family this holidays. Where are you work now?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	 Not me personally, not yet, but I've been with family for Christmas in the past. It's just an American tradition you see.
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	 My husband and I traveled to Africa for Christmas. It was the first time I have been out of the country since I was a teenager
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	 That sounds like a lot of fun. Where was the safari location in Africa?  I just volunteered at a school over the summer
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	 How was your time there? I have only traveled overseas for volunteer work once and it was very stressful but also a lot
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
