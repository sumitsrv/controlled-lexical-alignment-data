Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Howdy, it's going well. What a great day, I'm watching the weather channel!
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 Hi! I love the weekends as well. I like going to the park and looking at the stars and having fun in the sky!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 Are you going to the beach to watch the weekend coming up?
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Yes the Hokey is actually going to be on in my town!  I can't wait to watch it live
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 Are you going to the UFC event this weekend? I can't really watch it live because they don't have the best coverage where I am,
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I am actually really looking forward to it this weekend, and the UFC is coming to town too.  It should be a pretty good one.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 I am not going but that's pretty exciting you will win and have a good time.
