Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm good! What kind of cat was it?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I miss my cat too :( and I just tried the name shouting thing too lol her name is noodles.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would visit your house and bang your catfood dish with that name! Haha just kidding.. where did you vacation to?
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to be anywhere where there are lakes and rivers to swim. As you can imagine the rainforest is a great idea.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I would love to be able to do the zipline but I'm scared of heights.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 Haha! I would just want one that you could ride and not have to make any stops! I want to go to Australia, that sounds so fun
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 Well there are zipline races. I don't think you should try one then
