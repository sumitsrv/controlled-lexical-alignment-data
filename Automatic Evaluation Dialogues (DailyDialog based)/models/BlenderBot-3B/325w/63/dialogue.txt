Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland is the BEST place for Christmas. What a great idea! 
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 I have never been to Disneyland but would love to check it out
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 Yes I would love to and we will probably do the same for Christmas!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 Disneyland resorts are in the city and they have tons more things to do then just kids can have fun with.
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I would but the resort in downtown Disney is closed that time. Do you think they have Airbnb's in Downtown Disney?
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 Sure are you in that time range of December-March?
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 Yes that time frame would be perfect for my son as well! What are you getting your little one for christmas?
