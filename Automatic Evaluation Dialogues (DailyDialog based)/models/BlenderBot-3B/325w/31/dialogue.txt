Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!
Human 1:	 Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?
Human 2:	 Yeah it was great, the traveling and living in a new environment were really fun, but travelling took a long time for me, around
Human 1:	 Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?
Human 2:	 Yeah, I was so sad when I ran out of money. Vietnam is the world's longest travel partner in human and animal life on
Human 1:	 Hehe! How long was the stay?
Human 2:	 Yes, the travel was great, I went to Vietnam and Thailand. It is still on my list too. How long were
Human 1:	  Great! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.reat! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.
Human 2:	 I haven't gone back for awhile. I was planning to the next time around though. Good thing you still have time to stay and travel
Human 1:	 Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts 🙂 I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing.
Human 2:	 Good for you. How about the projects being aligned and back at work in time to plan.
Human 1:	 True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?
Human 2:	 True.  I should probably work some time aside and save for the next go.
Human 1:	 Okay. See tomorrow then.
Human 2:	 yeah tomorrow should work. What about you? I think for me the quarter being pushed earlier than normal is making me nervous lol
