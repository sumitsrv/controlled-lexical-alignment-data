B|7| Human 2: [i'm] not [working] [full time] [but] [was] [part] _of_ [some] [college] [classes] [that] [take] place around [work] _so_ _it's_ pretty much _the_ same thing haha 
A|8| Human 1: [i] feel [you] on [that] ! [it's] important [to] balance all [the] _different_ parts [of] [your] brain . _i like_ _pottery_ _because_ [i] also _drink_ _a_ lot [of] _tea_ , [so] [i] _get_ [to] _make_ [some] _tea_ ware . 
B|9| Human 2: yes [i] am in [college] and taking [pottery classes] too . [it's] [part time] [because] [some] [work full time] and [sewing] [is] [the] [way] [i] relax . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _would_ _love_ [to] build _one_ , _once_ [i] acquire [the] skills [to] ! _what kind_ [of] _tea_ [is] [your] favorite ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [love] [pottery] [but] [the] [classes] [that] [are] [once] [a] month or twice [a] month [get] too expensive , [you] [drink] too much lol . 
A|12| Human 1: ahh , those [are] mostly _from_ japan , no ? _i like_ white _teas_ , _like_ silver needle . 
B|13| Human 2: [i like] green [tea] [the] most . [it's] [the] [one] [that] tastes [the] freshest and [the] best [for] [you] . [what kind] [would] [you] [make] ? 
A|14| Human 1: [i] _actually_ found [a] youtube channel called <redacted_term> [that [i] like] [a] lot . [you] should check it out ! [the] host talks [about] all kinds [of] _different_ _teas_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [you] [are] [actually] right [, but] [some] [teas] [from] [different] countries [like] [tea] [that] [you] [get] in [the] us .
