Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I'm great so far! Just got done going hiking, and you?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I'm going to school part time now that I work full time. What about you? How's your day?
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I'm not working full time but was part of some college classes that take place around work so it's pretty much the same thing haha
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 Yes I am in college and taking pottery classes too. It's part time because some work full time and sewing is the way I relax.
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 I love pottery but the classes that are once a month or twice a month get too expensive, you drink too much lol.
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 I like green tea the most. It's the one that tastes the freshest and the best for you. What kind would you make?
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 You are actually right, but some teas from different countries like tea that you get in the US.
