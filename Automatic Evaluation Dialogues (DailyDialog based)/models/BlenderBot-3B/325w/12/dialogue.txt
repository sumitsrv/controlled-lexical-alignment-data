Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey how's it going
Human 1:	 It's good it's good. How are you?
Human 2:	 It's good to be off of work and it makes me really happy to see you are well
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where do you live?
Human 2:	 It's good you are well. I live in italy, what about you?
Human 1:	 Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....
Human 2:	 It's hot here in the Phoenix area. 114 is very hot for us during summer time in these parts.
Human 1:	 Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!
Human 2:	 I live in the southeastern USA and it was about the same. Tokyo was nice, and hot. The humidity
Human 1:	 Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha
Human 2:	 I've been to Italy and the Tokyo area, I loved the fact that you could eat onsen everywhere.
Human 1:	 The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!
Human 2:	 I also went on Disney Tokyo which I think is the largest all time and is pretty unique for a Disneyland haha. The onsen there
Human 1:	 I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google "giant robot fighting show tokyo" haha
Human 2:	 I can't wait to go! what was the robot fighting show you went to? It sounds cool! also, onsen are pretty different,
