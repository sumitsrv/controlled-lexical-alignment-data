Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 I had some goodies, they are my favorite candy from microkitchen
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 I guess they are out of goodies that I needed the other day because all I got were some cold socks and water
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 That sounds good that they are out of cold socks.  I hate the weather, it changes too much and get too cold too quickly.
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 It did get cold. Where are you that you needed jackets?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live in New york too, but the weather here is cold for us right now, so I am trying to get used to warmer weather
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 New york is the cold and they are out of socks, it's been snowing for a week straight.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 The weather has been cold and rainy the last few days in ny. It's making for long walk outdoors time with the dogs.
