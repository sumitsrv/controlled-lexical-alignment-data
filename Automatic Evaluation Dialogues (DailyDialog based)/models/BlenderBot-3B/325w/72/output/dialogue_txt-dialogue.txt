B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back _too_ much on _things_ , _but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for_ _me_ in terms _of_ _time_ _spent_ _with_ _family_ _and_ _friends _and_ _work_ life_ balance . why _do you_ ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [too] [have been very] _busy_ [with] [life] [and work] [but] [spent] [time] [with] [friends and] [family] [too] . 
A|4| Human 1: _great !_ _good_ _idea_ _to help_ _people_ figuring _out_ _their_ _new year_ resolutions 🙂 _so_ _how_ _do_ [i] get _a_ fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [good] [for] [you] _! i_ [have been very] _busy_ [with] [work] [and] [family] as well [but] [things] [have been] going well [and] 2019 will _not_ _be a_ [year] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ [! _i] think_ _the idea_ does _have some_ potential _. how did you_ come up _with this_ _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: well [that] seems [very] responsible [and] [you] [have some] selfless [work] ethic [. how did you] make [the] [new year] go _with it_ ? 
A|8| Human 1: _thats great !_ _this is_ _valuable_ _help_ _for the community_ _. i think_ mental _health_ _is one of the_ bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [thats great !] well _my_ [idea] was [for the community] [to help] [out] [one] another [and] [think] [of] [new] [things] [that] they can start doing [to] improve [their] [health] [and] 
A|10| Human 1: _that is_ actually [a] quote stolen from [my] tl when [i] joined [my] first _company_ after graduation _. i_ guess _now_ after 5 _yrs_ [of] [work] experience _, i_ fully agree [with it] 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [that is] [the idea] [, i] [have been] [with this] [company] [for] 10 [yrs] [now] [and work] [very] hard at [it] , [that] has paid off [. i think] 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i think] [family] [and] [friends] play [a] _big_ role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] may mean exploring around [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] [busy] ... _so_ on 🙂 [what] _about_ [you] ? [is] there [a] right answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [new] [friends and] [family] are [the] most [valuable] [people] [to] [have] [for] [you] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's very_ thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also _music_ earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's very] inspiring [for] [you] [and] congratulations [with] [that] . [this [is] one of the] [big] [things] [about] [work life] , it's all [about] 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am actually [not] much [of] [a] reader [. i] usually hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [me] [too] [and] i've found [that's] [not] always [so] easy . [what] kind [of] [music] [do you] like ? 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! [it] may turn [out] [to] [be a] best seller :)
