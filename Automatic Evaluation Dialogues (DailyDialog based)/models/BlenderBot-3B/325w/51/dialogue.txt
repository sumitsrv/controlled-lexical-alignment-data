Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It has been good. I bought a horse and spent most of the day with her
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's been great, but some of the money spent was with like, my friends haha. How long have you had your horse?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 I'm great, just finished watching some horse racing, good that's what I like doing with the money I put down most of the day.
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I've had my horse since before I got my drivers license. Ever been going down a sea fishing?
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 Well you got me there I'm just going over to my favorite spot down by the creek to go fishing, its been nice chatting
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I like fishing but prefer landlocked areas outside the city. What part of New York are you from?
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I like the city because of its amenities such as restaurants, parks, museums. What about you?
