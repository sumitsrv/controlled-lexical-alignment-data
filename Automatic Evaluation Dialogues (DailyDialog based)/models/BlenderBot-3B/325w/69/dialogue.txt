Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 How was your party last week?
Human 2:	 Hi! How was your week! I was having one last week.
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 I ate a bunch hahaha I was so hungry! How was your Thanksgiving?
Human 1:	 Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways
Human 2:	 It was funny, no one was mad at each other which is the main thing. How was yours?
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 Mine was really good, I cooked a bunch of homemade stuffing from scratch and I got some delicious turkey from family, it
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 Mine was always small turkey. I don't like the big Thanksgiving dinners and prefer to cook outside with all you can eat oven
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 Did you have any special turkey things prepared for your Thanksgiving?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 I did have fun with the games and all that. I was just disappointed that it was so small. Maybe my family is pampered.
