Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I'm sleepy all the time. It's pretty normal, we all get tired.
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I have a hard time staying awake all night myself. 
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm not feeling all that well today myself. Biology was always easy to me, I loved it.
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I'm a biology major haha, high school was so easy I'm sure it has gone by so fast
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I'm actually thinking about going into medicine, but school is so long and daunting
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 I actually think you'd be pretty good at that. You seem to see so much of the brain.
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 I can but that is something I am really afraid of
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 I have always thought that too! I think you can practice with something though, like a mummer I mean it was one of the first things
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 Yeah that would have been helpful for the med school application. I was too shy so I didn't even try.
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
