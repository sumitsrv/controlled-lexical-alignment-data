A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: how's _it_ going ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i'm_ _so_ _sleepy_ _today_ ! 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [sleepy] _all_ _the_ time . it's pretty normal , we _all_ get tired . 
A|4| Human 1: _yeah_ _was_ working _all night_ on _a_ homework 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ _have_ [a] hard time staying awake [all night] myself . 
A|6| Human 1: _biology_ . [i'm] gonna _be_ [a] doc someday ha 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] _not_ feeling [all] _that_ well [today] myself . [biology] [was] always easy _to_ me , _i_ loved _it_ . 
A|8| Human 1: no _high school_ _actually_ _haha_ 
B|9| Human 2: [i'm] [a] [biology] major [haha] , [high school] [was] [so] easy [i'm] sure _it_ has gone by [so] fast 
A|10| Human 1: [i] wanna _be_ [a] _brain_ surgeon !! 
B|11| Human 2: [i'm] [actually] _thinking about_ going into medicine , but [school] _is_ [so] long _and_ daunting 
A|12| Human 1: kind _of_ _i think_ 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [actually] [think] you'd [be] pretty good at _that_ . _you_ seem _to_ see [so] much [of] _the_ [brain] . 
A|14| Human 1: [is] [that] _something_ _you can practice_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] [can] but [that] [is] [something] [i] am really afraid [of] 
A|16| Human 1: [i] honestly _thought_ _it was one of_ those _things_ [you] [have] [to] [be] born _with_ ... [not] [that] [you] shouldn't _try_ _though_ ! 
B|17| Human 2: [i] [have] always [thought] [that] _too_ ! [i think] [you can practice] [with] [something] [though] , like [a] mummer [i] mean [it was one of] _the_ first [things] 
A|18| Human 1: maybe its [a] little [too] early [to] _even_ [be] [thinking about] this . just aim _for_ _med school_ [and] enjoy [the] journey ! 
B|19| Human 2: [yeah] [that] would [have] been helpful [for] [the] [med school] application . [i] [was] [too] shy [so] [i] didn't [even] [try] . 
A|20| Human 1: what other subjects do [you] enjoy ? [try] [to] keep an open mind !
