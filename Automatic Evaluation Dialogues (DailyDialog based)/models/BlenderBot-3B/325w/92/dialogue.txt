Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 It's good. Just getting my hair done for the weekend. You?
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 Just hanging out in the sun. Haha It's coming back to me.
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 Haha that's funny. We went to the beach all day in the sun. It was pretty enjoyable! What did you end up doing for
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 Well that sounds like a good use of the day I thought about the beach. I work near water, yes.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 I have never thought of that! I work for the university near a water park that is open all day so that is a good idea
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 Hmmm yes it's dangerous but the pay is pretty good I like that I have all the work to myself most of the day.
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I work at the beach and have heard that most climbers fall because they are not in shape enough. I am in pretty good shape but never
