A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's great_ , _thanks_ . _i'm trying to learn how to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [it's great] _and_ [i'm trying to learn how to make] hot dogs at home , my favorite food . 
A|4| Human 1: i've done _them_ _once_ or twice _so_ far , _but_ _they_ haven't _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm trying to] figure _out_ why . what _kind of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ made ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ am [trying to learn how to] cook [croissants] [but] [i'm] [kind of] [flakey] at _it_ also , [they] seem difficult [to make] [but] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ am [good] [thanks] [but] [croissants] are [so] difficult , they've [been] _a_ long process [to learn how to make] [them] right . 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is _a good_ idea . i'll give [it] [a] try next _time_ . _would_ _you_ _say_ _you_ _have_ [a] _sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ am more [flakey] then [you] . _i_ [have] [to make] [cookies] [once] in [a] while because _that's_ [how] _i_ spend my [time] [out] [of] _the_ 
A|10| Human 1: some people don't ! [but] yeah , _me_ too , [i] think i'd _eat_ _pastries_ all [the] [time] if [i] could _get_ away _with_ _it ._ 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [would] [say] [that] [i'm] [the] opposite . [i] [get] flaky [a] lot [with] [pastries] _and_ baked goods in general 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort _of stuff_ _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ _being_ marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused all sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [have] [the] [sweet tooth] for [that] [kind [of] stuff] [and] [with] [me] [being] diabetic its [a good] thing [i] [was] able [to] [eat] [it .] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
