Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking, about to go to game.  What position you play?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I'm great! It's about time for soccer to end but I think I prefer to exercise with friends. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I play for an academy so we play on the weekends with a youth team. It's a lot of fun, but I would prefer
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I like it but I'm not much good with the Switch.  I do like Nintendo's consoles, though. 
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I love the nintendo switch for it's fun games like Mario Odyssey but there are so many good games too
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 I like to read too. What's the book about?
