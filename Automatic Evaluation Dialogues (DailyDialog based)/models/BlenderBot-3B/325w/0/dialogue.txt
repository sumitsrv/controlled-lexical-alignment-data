Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 My favorite one is christmas. You get to meet people from all different cultures and places.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Oh, wow! That's a lot. Do you get all the different santas and a lot of people to meet?
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 I think it was a big holiday, so lots of people were there.
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 yes it's really neat but I think it's even more interesting to learn what people from around the world are coming there and what they are bringing back
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 I mean that is where you are from and what country you are coming back from.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 That's the spooky part. There are over 6 billion people and you only get to meet them one at a time.
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 That's true, what you mean is like people treasure hunting and trying to find where they came from before they were taken.
