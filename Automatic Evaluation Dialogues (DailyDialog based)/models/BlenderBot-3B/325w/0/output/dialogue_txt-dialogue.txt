A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ is your favorite holiday ? 
A|2| Human 1: _one_ _where_ _i_ _get to meet_ _lots of_ _different_ _people_ . 
B|3| Human 2: my favorite [one] is christmas . _you_ [get to meet] [people] _from_ all [different] cultures _and_ places . 
A|4| Human 1: hard [to] keep _a_ count . maybe 25 . 
B|5| Human 2: oh , _wow ! that's_ [a] lot . _do you_ [get] all _the_ [different] santas _and_ [a] lot [of] [people] [to meet] ? 
A|6| Human 1: _i think it was_ australia 
B|7| Human 2: [i think it was] [a] big holiday , _so_ [lots of] [people] were there . 
A|8| Human 1: not _really_ . [the] interactions _are_ usually short-lived _but_ _it's_ fascinating _to learn_ _where_ [people] _are coming_ _from and what_ matters [to] _them_ 
B|9| Human 2: yes [it's] [really] neat [but] [i think] [it's] even more _interesting_ [to learn] [what] [people] [from] around [the] world [are coming] there [and what] they [are] bringing back 
A|10| Human 1: [what] [do _you] mean_ ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [mean] that is [where] [you] [are] [from and what] country [you] [are coming] back [from] . 
A|12| Human 1: [wow ! that's] [interesting] , borderline _spooky_ 
B|13| Human 2: [that's] [the] [spooky] part . there [are] over 6 billion [people] [and] [you] only [get to meet] [them] [one] at [a] time . 
A|14| Human 1: [so] , [do you] [do] _treasure hunting_ often ? 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] true , [what] [you mean] is like [people] [treasure hunting] [and] trying [to] find [where] they came [from] before they were taken .
