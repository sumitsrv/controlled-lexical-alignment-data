Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty good so far, just got back from work. I'm going to see family.
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 Oh you have work for the Thanksgiving break? I hope you finish those up before then.
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Yeah the work before Thanksgiving break, I like to have fun but I'm pretty quiet.
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I've not started yet just getting ready for work. I like to run as well, what do you do for fun?
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I like to have fun as well but sometimes you need a break haha just don't wanna get tired
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I like long distances as well, it helps me get my mind off the breakup for a bit. 
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I like running too. This year marathon is one of the longest distances run every where.
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 This year was tough, it was run like a marathon with a half-marathon one day and then a full on the next.
