Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty great too! What kind of game is it?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I just won the powerball, but i'm still taking credit for it lol
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I'm great thank you but for the game I won I just bought my first house
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 that's great I'm just happy for you! It's a game with a ball where you have to knock the ball into the goal with your rac
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 It's very physical and I'm not very good but the game is a lot of fun.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 It's like tennis, but it's played with a racquet and a ball that can't bounce back and hits really hard
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
