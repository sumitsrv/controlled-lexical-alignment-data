A|6| Human 1: haha _thank you_ , [i] guess _i'm just_ _a_ natural . what's _your_ favourite [game] ? 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thank you] [but] [for] the [game] [i won] [i just] bought my first house 
A|8| Human 1: what's racquetball _like_ ? from context clues , [i'm] guessing _that_ [it] involves hitting _a ball_ _with a racquet_ 
B|9| Human 2: that's [great] [i'm just] happy [for] [you] ! _it's a_ [game] [with [a] ball] where [you] have _to_ knock the [ball] into the goal [with] [your] rac

B|13| Human 2: [it's] [like] [tennis] [, but] [it's] played [with a racquet] [and] [a ball] [that] can't bounce back [and] hits [really] hard 
A|14| Human 1: [what] [a] [good] idea , i'd love [to] !
