A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: _i am_ [the] _superman !_ _what _about_ _you_ ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: oh [you] [superman !] well [the] weather _is_ nice _. i am_ just sitting _in_ front of _my_ tv waiting _for_ [the] kids _to_ finish playing _. [what_ about] 
A|4| Human 1: _being invisible ._ [you] won't _see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: [you] must be [the] best [superman] ever ! [i] have _a_ hard time [being invisible .] even while [i] was _in_ _my_ childhood [i] couldnt 
A|6| Human 1: _i would_ rather _trust fmri_ _and_ _machine learning_ [to] _do_ _this_ [. i am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry [for] it ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i would] [not] [trust fmri] [for] anything . 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ _thing_ _that_ _can _tell_ you_ [a] brain's activity at [a] _pretty high_ _resolution_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [machine learning] [thing] that's [pretty high] tech [and] [resolution] [for] [imaging] can't [see] [you ?] that's frightening [for] sure 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _believe_ [in] _science_ ! _science_ [is] [my] god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [the] [thing] that's frightening [about] [this] [is] [that] [you] never realize [what] [brain imaging] [can tell] us [about you] [for] [a] long time . 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm bad_ at _science_ [. what] [can] _science_ _do_ ? [is] it [the] most important [thing] [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [pretty] [bad] as well . [science] [can] [do] [a] lot [and] [tell you] [what] [the] world actually [is] . [i'm] still waiting [for] [that] technology 
A|14| Human 1: does it _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i] can't [believe] that's [what] [the] [machine learning] [thing] [is] ! science's ability [to] [make sense] of [the] physical world [is] awesome ... [i'm bad]
