Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 Oh you superman! Well the weather is nice. I am just sitting in front of my tv waiting for the kids to finish playing. What about
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 You must be the best superman ever! I have a hard time being invisible. Even while I was in my childhood I couldnt
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 I would not trust fMRI for anything.
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 The machine learning thing that's pretty high tech and resolution for imaging can't see you? That's frightening for sure
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 The thing that's frightening about this is that you never realize what brain imaging can tell us about you for a long time.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 I'm pretty bad as well.  Science can do a lot and tell you what the world actually is. I'm still waiting for that technology
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I can't believe that's what the machine learning thing is! Science's ability to make sense of the physical world is awesome...I'm bad
