Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 It's the same where you met me, have you ever used my donut stash? Lol
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 No, I don't think so. Did you dance to the Beach Boys?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 Lol schwasty's don't dance, they have the moves for sure, you can see it in their music
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I have never been to the Ocean City or Palo Alto before. Do you like it? 
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I do not know what that is either. I'm sure you have heard of Sixtals and Alto Sapphire, though right
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 You sure know that's not elitist but I'm not going to pretend that I have never heard of either of those places! Lol. O
