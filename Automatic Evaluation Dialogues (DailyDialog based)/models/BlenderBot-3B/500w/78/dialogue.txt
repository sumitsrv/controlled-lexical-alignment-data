Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 I don't want to be a pastry chef, but just baking in general. It is a fine art that needs to be perfected
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 I was not that good actually. It was just a guess, haha.  Are you a psychic?
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I was actually a psychic not too long ago! lol you have the ability and know that cake chef is far from it.
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 haha that is a good guess.  I love to bake and have made all the best cake you can imagine but never thought about psychic powers
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 What a shame you can't say that haha! I guess for the best foods, I enjoy cake and cookies. Chocolate chef's work
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 I was a baker for years and then I became the Chief Baker at the Best Buy bakery I work at now
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I enjoy the work I have now but want to make cool cakes like that, and not a day job. I want to be a chef
