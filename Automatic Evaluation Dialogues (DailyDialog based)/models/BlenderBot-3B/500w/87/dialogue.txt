Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I just started a new job!
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book "The Name of the Rose" what are you reading?
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book on how to sleep better, have you ever slept over someone that does not like you? 
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I like books that are more about personal growth. Zero does have lots of tips on how to sleep better but I read it years ago.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 Zero to One seems like it's about personal growth that I would love to read about and how to deal with being in a world where you have
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 No but I like the books about how it's better for you in other words and also the contrarian book might help you sleep well
Human 1:	 yup!
