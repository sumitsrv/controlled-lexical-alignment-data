Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 No, I have not heard of it. What is it about?
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 What a great film! It was released by Motown and has Tom Cruise as the main character. I loved his performance of The Rat
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 Yes, the last film I saw was Mandalorian, that Tom Cruise movie
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 I was. I wanted to see the Mandalorian and Tom Cruise did a great job. I like Marvel as a whole so
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I don't think I've seen the last Mandalorian. I can't remember the name. What other movies you have seen by Mar
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I think that was the only marvel movie I've seen too... not really big on Marvel myself and I don't watch movies in general.
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I really like the Marvel movies. Who was your favorite character and actor playing Mandalorian?
