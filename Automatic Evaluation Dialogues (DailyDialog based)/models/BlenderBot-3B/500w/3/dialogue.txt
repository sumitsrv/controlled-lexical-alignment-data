Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 It raining pretty bad today.  Hopefully, they close the stadium.
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 Yes the rain was pretty bad today. They closed early that day too.
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Yes the water has been coming down and has flooded lots of peoples houses and the water was very hard to control
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 the weather can make you a little sad sometimes. rain makes me think that I want to sit on my roof and just listen to the rains
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 lol that's funny but I don't think the rains here will make me want to sit in water like that ever again.
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 that droughts you talk about did make you think that was the case?
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
