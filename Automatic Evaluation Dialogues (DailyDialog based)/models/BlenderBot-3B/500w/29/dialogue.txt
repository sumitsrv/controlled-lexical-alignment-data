Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! How are you doing 🙂
Human 1:	 I'm great! How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Great day! I'm going to a baseball game! How about you?
Human 1:	 Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?
Human 2:	 I am working part time, great that you are going to a game! What class?
Human 1:	 Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!
Human 2:	 I'm better today than I was yesterday but better that way for work.  I take pottery classes from time to time also.
Human 1:	 I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.
Human 2:	 you feel like your better because sewing pottery is important work, the way all that's different from regular working class
Human 1:	 I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?
Human 2:	 I love tea but I drink way too much of it, the pottery class is relaxing also because I get to work with my own hands.
Human 1:	 Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.
Human 2:	 I like all kind's tea but the one that I drink the most would be a green tea. It relaxes me from all the stress of having
Human 1:	 I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.
Human 2:	 You are correct that teas from japan mostly like white ones, but also Chinese tea called the yellow one is actually good as well
