A|12| Human 1: ahh , those [are] _mostly_ _from japan_ , no ? _i _like_ white_ _teas_ , [like] silver needle . 
B|13| Human 2: [i like] [all] kind's [tea] [but] [the] [one] _that i_ [drink] [the] most [would] be [a] green [tea] . [it] relaxes me [from] [all the] stress [of] having 
A|14| Human 1: [i] _actually_ found [a] youtube channel _called_ <redacted_term> [that [i] like] [a] lot . [you] should check [it] out ! [the] host talks [about] [all] kinds [of] [different] _teas_ . 
B|15| Human 2: [you] [are] correct [that] [teas] [from japan] [mostly] [like white] ones [, but] [also] chinese [tea] [called] [the] yellow [one] [is] [actually] good as well
