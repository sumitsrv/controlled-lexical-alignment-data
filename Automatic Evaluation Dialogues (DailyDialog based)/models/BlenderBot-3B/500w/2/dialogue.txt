Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Just relaxin, how are you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 A long time I was shocked when I last seen him
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 I was going to say it had been long time for me, but maybe this friend just needed a vacation lol
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Not really much changed. But the last time we had been together was over 10 years ago.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Oh really? A lot changed for me. I had a kid recently but life was pretty bland until I was like 21.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 My life has been pretty exciting, but that was really the only time I have had any significant adventures like this recently.
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 Oh yeah that does sounds exciting. What kind of adventures you want to try?
