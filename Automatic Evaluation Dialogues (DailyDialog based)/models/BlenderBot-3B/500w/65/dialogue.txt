Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Well, my day is going swell, I made my lunch for tonight, and your's?
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 How's the shop going so far?
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 Ehhh that's a bummer lol. The shop broke down and I had to wait hours trying to figure out what caused the problem
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 That's good that you don't drive the moped now lol
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Yeah. That sounds good.
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Haha you know their record is hard to refute but the way they have been playing and that they don't finish games today makes me think they will
