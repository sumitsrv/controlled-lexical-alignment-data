Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 Just had some delicious microkitchen items for lunch. How are you?
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 I'm good...it's cold out there. I guess the jacket is needed. 
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 Its good, its still cold out, the wind that makes our hair curl makes it even worse
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 Where did you live before that the cold weather is extreme for you?
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 I live the cold New York weather now its so nice for me
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 I remember the last time they ran out of food for hurricane irma, that was terrible.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 The one after the last time they ran out there and it was cancelled our work for overnights and even some holidays?
