Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello there!
Human 1:	 How has your morning been thus far?
Human 2:	 Its been going good. How about you? I'm going to the farmer market today.
Human 1:	 Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.
Human 2:	 I'm ok.. Just been going through some morning issues that have my sleep time off so I'm up far too late
Human 1:	 WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?
Human 2:	 I work for the day and have been going through that a lot too.  I did go to the farmer market today though. It was fun
Human 1:	 Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?
Human 2:	 I have been going through the same problem you have and that's always tough to go back to work even after having time off
Human 1:	 Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?
Human 2:	 I don't even know what you that means. How was the acupuncture?
Human 1:	 I'm a comic.
Human 2:	 I'm the same way, you know that acupuncture has been around for thousands of years and there is always people trying to come up
Human 1:	 It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.
Human 2:	 It's not bad but I'm not sure it will work
