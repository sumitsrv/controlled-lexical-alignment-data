Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I just ate breakfast, which always makes me feel great the day after! What kind of food was it?
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I'm great and thanks, just had breakfast too. eggs hash browns and toast, the healthier your day was the greater I feel
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat my favorite food which is a hamburger and eggs
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I'm one of those that would eat mcdonalds forever. I know food has health benefits but I just think the orange food is delicious
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I'd say the complete food would be good.  Soylent only has one nutrition that's what makes it so great and its so
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I can understand that, you like the taste of the orange food which has health benefits. What other foods are you interested in eating?
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
