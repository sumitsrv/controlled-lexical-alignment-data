Human 2:	 Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?
Human 1:	 Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?
Human 2:	 Not very busy so far, thank god
Human 1:	 Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?
Human 2:	 I was actually very busy that day doing the weekend plans for all my siblings and their children.
Human 1:	 Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?
Human 2:	 I plan to visit the home of my family and for fun will just stay home
Human 1:	  Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.
Human 2:	 Sounds great, you are very lucky for having the time and resources to visit your family. Europe's a big place, that will surely be fun
Human 1:	  Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.
Human 2:	 It's great that you're learning the language for your children and you will make connections with other spanish speaking people.
Human 1:	  Thanks! Let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible. Hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well
