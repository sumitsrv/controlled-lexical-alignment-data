Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 I'm well just enjoying some daytime. How are you
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 the weekends are always the best day of the week
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 Hi are you going out the weekend? I'm looking forward to some daytime. I watch live on HBO and NBC
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 I really can't wait for the weekend, I love going out, and you are right, Hokey can be violent haha.
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 Haha, actually live is the best but this will have to do for now. You like UFC? The violent kind?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I like UFC but the amateur part just can't compare to this.
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah I'm not that good myself but still have fun and try to give it a shot every weekend. It's the best work out there. H
