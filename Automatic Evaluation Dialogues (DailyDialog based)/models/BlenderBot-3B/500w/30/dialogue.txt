Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	 lol you're so organized, I like it!
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	 Kale is the leaves of the canis lupus familiaris? I have not really studied about it much, just for it to cook
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	 No but I have a friend who really loves kale. I think it might be the texture more than anything. Kale can be eaten
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	 Yeah, computer language is the art of problem solving, kale can really be enjoyed with a side of cheese cake or as the other's favorite
Human 1:	 Yes!
