Human 1:	 What do you do to unwind?
Human 2:	 I love getting my kids ready and getting the kids dressed for school so I could relax at home
Human 1:	 Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.
Human 2:	 I also used to be more of a phone person when we have them but now just mostly watch TV and travel. What about you?
Human 1:	 In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that’s why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?
Human 2:	 I do that aswell but mostly just with the baby when it is napping
Human 1:	 What is your favorite show to watch right now?
Human 2:	 That's great! What do you think about the show though?
Human 1:	 I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.
Human 2:	 I never was that much into baby showers but watching videos online and babies are the cutest thing in the world I think. I watch Lil
Human 1:	 Do you like cats or dogs better? Do you have any pets?
Human 2:	 I like cats better and have dogs. Cats are pets that are rescue animals. But the show was great.
