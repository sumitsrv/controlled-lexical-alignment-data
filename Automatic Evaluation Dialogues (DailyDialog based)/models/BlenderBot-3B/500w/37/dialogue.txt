Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great! What game you meeting your friends for?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I think you mean with friends, but I'm good thanks for asking. What's your soccer game about?
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I'm getting great exercise but would probably prefer to play a game with friends and family. Switch? It's fun to just be able to kick
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I play it with friends in a group but it's not as fun for me. 
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I like the Ninja Gaiden for the nintendo Switch but it's too much for me just read a book or something
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 I like adventure for the most part, what's it about? What are you thinking about reading?
