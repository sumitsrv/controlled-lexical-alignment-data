A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ _have_ _a_ _favourite flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ _like_ pomegranate but _the_ [flower] market can be tough . 
A|4| Human 1: i'm _working_ on _a_ theory . _why_ does [the] _lotus_ spring _to_ mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ was [working] for [the] [flower] market _and_ _we_ [have] [lotus] which _is_ [the] oldest tree living in north america ! 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ _a_ _personal_ theory . [i] _think that_ [flower] _preferences_ _are_ more revealing _of_ personality than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i] [have] [not] had [the] opportunity [to] [have] any [lotus] [flower] _that's_ [why] _it_ was _so_ exciting ! 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _gerbera_ . _it's_ _like a_ cartoon [flower] . _as_ if _you_ drew "flower" _with_ _a_ crayon [and] then [it] came [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [flower] market _is_ definitely something [i] [have] [not] dabbled [with] ! [it's] [the] [life] [and] youth [of] [gerbera] [that] 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , _you_ _ask_ someone _what_ _their favourite flower is ._ pretty much [like] _what_ [we] _just_ _did_ . does [that] _make_ sense [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [did] [not] [think that] [you] were studying [it] [as] [like a] flowering plant [just] [what] [are] [their] [personal] [preferences] [and] how [people] feel . 
A|12| Human 1: _cool_ . step 2: talk [with] [the] person some more , [and] _ask_ them some more _questions_ , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] [what] they're [like] , _over_ [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [cool] [that] [you] [are] able [to] [ask] [questions] [like] [that] [and] [make] [it] [a] discussion [over] [what] they [think] [their favourite flower is .] 
A|14| Human 1: [why] thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
