Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 I like pomegranate but the flower market can be tough.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I was working for the flower market and we have lotus which is the oldest tree living in North America!

Human 2:	 Cool that you are able to ask questions like that and make it a discussion over what they think their favourite flower is.
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
