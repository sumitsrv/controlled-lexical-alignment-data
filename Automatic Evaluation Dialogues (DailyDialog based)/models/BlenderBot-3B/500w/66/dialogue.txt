Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 Hi. Nope. I didn't have any improvements.
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 It is the marathoning you see, but I'm actually just doing the race so I can improve my time for the sporting events coming
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 It's not overtly and triathlons but they're still like marathon events.
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 Sporting events not only the running but also the high jumping and jumping obstacles like cross country skiing and marathons,
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 That's very cool. It has been one of the Olympic events since like the late 1950's. I think I'll sign up
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 I would love to but the time and amount of training needed for one seems like too much work.  It's not about how fast you can run
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 There's one coming up next February for the Winter Olympics! I'd like to workout with you and help you out
