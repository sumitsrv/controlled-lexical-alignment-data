Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's good, but my wife is sick. I'm getting her fluids now to treat her illness. How are you?
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was great! I went rock climbing the day after the storm was about to hit, it's a good workout
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was the last movie I saw about a year before I went to sleep! It's called The Wolf of Wall Street
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 I saw that movie too and loved the darkness. It was very depressing. What about yourself?
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 Haha, that's awesome! and yes it can be scary too when the day turns dark and all the lights go out but I saw a movie about
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I can not wait to see it!  But the lights are off and the lights are out from here.  Yes, darkness is more scary
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 Yes I'd prefer the winter too but the darkness was nice and you can see more stars than here. Australia's are very scary.
