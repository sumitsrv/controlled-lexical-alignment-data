Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I got up early and made breakfast! I'm ready for a nap though.
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well are you cleaning your emails right now?
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 well, you said it but I enjoy cleaning my room but I don't get out much and that's okay, what are you doing today
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I like action movies but it's hard for me to enjoy outside work because I'm still a bit tired. 
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I like action movies but I don't really enjoy full on action films with lots of guns and cool stunts.  Terminators never happened to
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 that's cool haha but it will only get you so far, the real fun is with friends! what are you plans for the weekend?
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 Yeah it's not like the movies I watched that you get so engaged with the whole time you want the ending it will be great.
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 The ending didn't end happy but I want to see the action you know.
Human 1:	 Thanks!
