Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey sup
Human 1:	 not much. any plans this weekend?
Human 2:	 Going to this really cool bar, it will be my first real night out in a while.
Human 1:	 ziplining?
Human 2:	 I think we'll zipline over this waterfall. It's so much fun
Human 1:	 i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience
Human 2:	 I have not been ziplining in probably like 8 years, it's been quite some time. Are you having a good time?
Human 1:	 i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though
Human 2:	 it was local. where do you think you did it? any zip zining experience is unique
Human 1:	 that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you
Human 2:	 i have it once and see you later. that's going to be fun
Human 1:	 no, i'm going to get a massage first
Human 2:	 i was and i'm going to get a massage tomorrow too. have you been before?
Human 1:	 traditional kind
Human 2:	 I have never been to a massage that wasn't traditional and it's hard to believe it's been going on since the 1880's. So
Human 1:	 you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!
Human 2:	 I'm going to try it out, I think I might love massage after all that talk you've given me
