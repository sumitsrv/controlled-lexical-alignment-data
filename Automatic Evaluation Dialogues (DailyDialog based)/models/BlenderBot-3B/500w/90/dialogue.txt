Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I like sports you say? Would I be involved for tennis? It's the only sport I like to participate in.
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 I have volunteered before for the badminton events out in the Volunteer Center on the corner of Clyde and L
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 I have never participated in any events like that before. I will do some research and see if these happen near me for sure and I will try
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I have volunteered for other events before and I think these are fun.  There will be food and canned goods that you can take
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 well I am interested and the volunteer saturday event will be for fun.
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 well the next saturday will be a long time from now.. The event is in 2 weeks! how long have you all had the idea for this
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 Great. I have the next couple saturdays off and will attend with my friends and help out.
Human 1:	 Thanks.
