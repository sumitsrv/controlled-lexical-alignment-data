Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking at a few people I knew and chatting, how was your day?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 My day is just about over, I just came in from walking the dog. How is yours going?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 Peru isn't very good for us but it's beautiful the way your country is colored from one end to the other.
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 It's been good. Just relaxing for the moment. You are one brave person enjoying your cigar. Smoking isn't healthy but
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 You live once but you only go one way haha that's good what are your plans for the rest of the night
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 haha I believe so but not that reincarnation is a real thing, just thought it was an interesting thought. what would you say you think
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 That was much more thought-provoking. You just reminded me that reincarnation is a possibility. I think what you believe
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
