Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I watched Avatar in IMAX this afternoon, and it's easily the most breathtaking movie ever created.
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 I have watched Avatar the movie with blue people who were human-ish that's it but it's good
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 have you seen the movies that's out now like transformers
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 yea what else you have the meaningful story how people transform nature with outhuman-like behavior  but it's good
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 Yes I have and like it. What else do you bake?
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 I like baking some soup and noodle dishes that you have in chinese restaurants. I prefer to eat out when I eat
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 you know baking is the art and science of food preparation
