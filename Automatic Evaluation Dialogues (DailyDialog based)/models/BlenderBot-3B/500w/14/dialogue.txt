Human 2:	 Just chilling and you? Just went to the park today actually and rode that cool roller coaster
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I love amusement park roller coaster!
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 I am not but the roller coaster that you went on was scary yet?
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I went on that but the one I did not like was roller coaster 8 at Kingda Ka because you actually do not ride in a
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
