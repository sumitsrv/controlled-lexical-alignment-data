Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Bruhhhhhh, I am good! You?
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 It was going good. I have a day off so I went to the beach.
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm really sorry for that, did they tell you why it got shelved?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I've lost a loved one, and that's been very painful for sure. 
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I was sad for a day or so. Was just going to spend some time on the beach and relaxing.
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 I'm pretty happy now with a girl who's going out of town for the last time and are trying keto. It's been a long time
