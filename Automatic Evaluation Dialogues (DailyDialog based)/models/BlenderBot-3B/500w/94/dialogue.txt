Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 nope yet! you?
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 no and lunch did not exist yet. what about you
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm having chicken and vegetables.
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I had the buffet and some of the vegetarian dishes were good.  My pork was though lol
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I love the buffet style! They are pretty popular all over here, and some you can eat for lunch or dinner.
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 What kind of food was it then? I have had pork once at the buffet, wasn't too bad, can't eat much though,
