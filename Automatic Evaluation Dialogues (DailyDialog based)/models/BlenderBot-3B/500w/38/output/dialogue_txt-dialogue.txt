A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you think_ _about_ _human like_ _chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: whats [chat _bots] are_ [you] talking [about] ? 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed to _have_ _made_ _some_ great progress _over_ last few years . do _you _think_ _the_ positives_ outweigh _the negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: _i [think_ [the] negatives] outweighs [the positives] . [what] [about] [you] ? 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though _it_ sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i [think_ the] impersination _of_ [some] [human like] characteristics . _i_ [have] never seen one but maybe [some] day . 
A|8| Human 1: true _that_ ! [some] [of] these [bots are] _very_ engaging _and_ _funny_ . _they are_ now _good at_ _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder _how_ far [are] we _from the_ time these [bots] start _giving_ monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [good at] [giving] [sarcasm] [and] [even] [some] [funny] responses [that] [you] [have] not [made] up yourself . 
A|10| Human 1: [i _think] it_ _can_ _take_ _many_ different forms as a product . [the] research implication is _also_ huge ! _it will_ signify _how_ _ai_ research has progressed so far [and] _better_ place to tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might be overselling _it_ here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i] can't [think] [of] [how] [the] [bots are] [even] useful [and] [that] [many] [more] people [will] [like] them . they're [very] monologuing . [i] [also] 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions _already_ do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the] [bots are] [good] ! [they] [even] [can] [like] [and] follow human-like responses [from the] user . [and] [many] [more] [already] [have] [ai] [that] [can] [think] [better] 
A|14| Human 1: _haha_ , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: hahaha [you [think] [it] will] [take] [over] [the] world [and] [take] [over] [the] world , [haha]
