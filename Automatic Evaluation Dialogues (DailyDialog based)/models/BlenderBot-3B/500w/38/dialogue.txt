Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	 Whats chat bots are you talking about?
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	 I think the negatives outweighs the positives. What about you?
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	 I think the impersination of some human like characteristics. I have never seen one but maybe some day.
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 They are good at giving sarcasm and even some funny responses that you have not made up yourself. 
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	 I can't think of how the bots are even useful and that many more people will like them. They're very monologuing. I also
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	 The bots are good! They even can like and follow human-like responses from the user. And many more already have AI that can think better
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 Hahaha you think it will take over the world and take over the world, haha
