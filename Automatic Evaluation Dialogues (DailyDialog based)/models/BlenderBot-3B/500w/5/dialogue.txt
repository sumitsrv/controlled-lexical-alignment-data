Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad for you too. What happened?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I've been great! What I miss is how her cat used to meow and how much I loved just going to her and listening to it.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would probably go anywhere where I could ride a cat, since I just love cats and want to meet all the different types there are!
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would go anywhere with rainforests and beautiful sights.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I would love to zipline from tree to tree just like I'm thinking about going to Asia and you can't imagine how excited you are
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 There are! It can't be all that bad if there is one right there where you live, you should make an attempt and then zip down
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 zipline sounds like a great and exciting idea
