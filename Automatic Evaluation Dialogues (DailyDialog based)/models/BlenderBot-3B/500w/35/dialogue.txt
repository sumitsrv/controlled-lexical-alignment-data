Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's it going?
Human 1:	 I'm so sleepy today!
Human 2:	 I am doing great, I'm just about to sleep myself
Human 1:	 yeah was working all night on a homework
Human 2:	 I'm sleepy all of the time, I was just working night shift all last night
Human 1:	 Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha
Human 2:	 I'm tired all the time lately too.  Biology was soooo boring.
Human 1:	 no high school actually haha
Human 2:	 I'm actually a high school dropout haha
Human 1:	 I wanna be a brain surgeon!!
Human 2:	 I'm a high school dropout too! Are you working as a surgeon in your own home?
Human 1:	 Kind of I think
Human 2:	 Yes I'm working as a surgeon.
Human 1:	 Is that something you can practice?
Human 2:	 that's awesome, you can practice it but I think it's too late for you if you dropped out, you will already know a lot of it
Human 1:	 I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!
Human 2:	 It was something that I thought I was really interested in, but it wasn't for me. How come you didn't try for it though?
Human 1:	 Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!
Human 2:	 I have thought about it and even though the school for surgeon was one of the most selective that can you think of I just don't believe
Human 1:	 What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!
