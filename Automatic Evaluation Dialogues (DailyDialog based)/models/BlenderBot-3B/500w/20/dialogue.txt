Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 Chinese Food for sure, one of the greatest comfort foods in the world! What's your favorite? 
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 I think I love Chinese food too, it's one of my favorites to have when I'm sick, especially with a big ice cream sunda
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 That would be any kind of Chinese food for sure. Chocolate ice cream is the best! My favorite ice cream place is called Mandarin
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 I love the combination of ice cream and any sorbet. Creams are my favorite.
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 That's the one with a sorbet and ice cream? I love that ice cream!
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 I love the flavor and have no problem believing there is something more than this world. Ice cream is so nice after a long night in the pool
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
