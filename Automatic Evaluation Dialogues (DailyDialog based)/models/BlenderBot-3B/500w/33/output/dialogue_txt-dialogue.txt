A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ _great , thanks_ . _i'm_ trying _to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [great _, thanks] !_ [it's] [croissants] day in france ! 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ done _them_ once or twice _so far_ , _but they haven't been flakey enough_ . [i'm] trying _to_ figure _out_ why . _what _kind_ of_ _cookies_ _have you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] _some_ [croissants] [but they haven't been flakey enough] , either ! [what kind] [have you] tried [so far] ? 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought [, thanks !] 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [good] _too_ [but] _i_ [have] [been] [out] [of] _the_ kitchen for _a_ minute _now_ , my daughter _is_ cookin breakfast . _i_ [made] croiss 
A|8| Human 1: [now] _that_ [is] [a] [good] _idea_ . i'll give it [a] try next time . would [you] _say_ [you] _have a sweet tooth_ ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ [have] [cookies] [that] are [made] from [sweet] [croissants] [but they] are [kind of] [flakey] , _not_ crunchy [enough] [to make] [them] 
A|10| Human 1: [some] people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me [too] , [i] _think_ i'd _eat_ _pastries_ _all_ [the] time if _i could_ _get_ away _with_ it . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] [have a sweet tooth] for [pastries] [that] are dessert [but] [don't] usually [eat] sugar [with] my breakfast . [but] [you] can [get] [the] [good] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last time [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] _stuff_ _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] _fat_ substitute , _and_ caused _all_ sorts [of] crazy _stomach_ upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [have] [to] [say] [that] [was] [the] best [idea] [and] [i] [don't] [think] [i could] [stomach] [all] [that] [fat] [with] [sweet] [stuff] . 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
