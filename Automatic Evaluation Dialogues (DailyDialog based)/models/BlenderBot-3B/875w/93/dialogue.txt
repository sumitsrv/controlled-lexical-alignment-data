Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 It's really cold out this year for Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for?
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 It's for one called the Canada Day conference. I really can't wait to meet some good people this year, it should be a blast.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 It was for the Global Citizen Canada conference. I have always really liked all that they did and it's good to see them
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It's for the Young people conference. The one that was held in Canada. What did you all have to attend?
