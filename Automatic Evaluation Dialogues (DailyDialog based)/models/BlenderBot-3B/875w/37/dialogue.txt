Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm great thanks for asking. What game are you meeting friends and about?
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 It's fun with friends but I prefer by myself so I'm terrible for about an hour
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I would prefer with friends but you might think about getting it alone. It's fun to play online too so you don't have to worry about meeting
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I'd recommend it for you. Yes, it's fun with friends but great for yourself also. It would be something you'd play with others like
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I like adventure games but it's just too scary to play the game with friends for too long. It would get into my head!
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 What are the most recent adventure book you read? I just finished something like the Napoleonic Wars with Patrick O'Brien
