Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	 It was great, but I just came back from a ski trip also and we didn't see the sun until late last night
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 that sounds great but I got to back and ice skate after all haha
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	 you got that french from school but you forgot most of it? anyways i love skiing i know how you feel
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 No, but that doesn't make you any better at french than I do.  Did you have fun skiing and ice skating in
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I've always wanted to but never got the chance and you know how that goes haha. Did your french teacher teach skating or figure skating
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I've always wanted to go but haven't been skiing myself yet and don't think that I can do the figure skating just yet after
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 She used to, but she retired and I moved on
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
