Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 Great day, I went to go see The National a few days ago.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I love reading and writing papers. Hows your day been?
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I love to see a day go off and work mostly goes by quicker than expected and I would like to drift off sometimes
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 I love the social events and going out to eat and things during the day. Mostly work and saving. 
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would love to see the world from all perspectives and see what other places have going on, you never know about things until you travel
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 I would love too, going places to see the world with someone who cannot dive because you don't know much about diving and that person is
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 That's amazing that you can see the world with someone who dives, I would love to too one day.
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 That's so sad that someone can't dive after only a day. You should tell them about your friend! It's amazing what you can see
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
