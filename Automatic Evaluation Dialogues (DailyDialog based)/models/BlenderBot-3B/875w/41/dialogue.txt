Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 I do too many people get sick and need help and have a hard time getting it in this world
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 well promoted would be miracles too you know! You can't change who you are, just keep trying
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 What might you change about yourself what you believe can help people get through the next cycle and not be told they suck all because there's too many other
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 It's good you have the mindset that there's nothing out there that can change and not much we can do about them
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 I have not changed much but you might. Just try and empathise with people because you did not grow up the way they did.
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 Not much you can change about people who have not grown up with the luxury and means to get out and be successful.
