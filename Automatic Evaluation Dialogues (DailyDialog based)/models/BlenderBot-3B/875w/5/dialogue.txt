Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad too but I think we will both be okay. 
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I'm sad too and how is your day going? I've tried catfood too! I just miss her.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would like to go to Hawaii and just enjoy my vacation how is your day going
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would like to check out southeast Asia.  Maybe Japan and Korea. 
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I'm scared too about where I will be going and I won't even know when I will be there. It just sounds scary! I can't
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I would just try and make all you can from where you are right now.
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 zipline sounds scary and I would make sure there isn't one to go from where you are right now, just to be honest about it.
