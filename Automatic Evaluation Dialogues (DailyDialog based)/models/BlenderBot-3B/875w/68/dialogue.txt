Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?

Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 Sure you have time, the problem was that last week not your fault. You were still able to attend lectures this week.
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 No problem for not going this weekend the syllabus that's will be tough, course was very time consuming and hectic though
