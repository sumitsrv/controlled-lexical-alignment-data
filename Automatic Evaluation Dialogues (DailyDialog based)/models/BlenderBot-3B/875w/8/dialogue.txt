Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Good, been going out with some friends for drinks has your day?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I'm getting sick too with the colds and allergies! I think it may be pneumonia, I should have had better
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'm sick too, my nose has been all stuffed out for the last week with a cold... I think I have pneumonia
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I'm getting sick with allergies too! Nothing exciting for the most part either.
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I have allergies too! It's the worst this year even though it should be the most humid in like ever. I'm going to
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I did have plans for the beaches this weekend. It's going to be humid there, too.
