Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It's good too. I spent most of today watching hockey!
Human 1:	 I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?
Human 2:	 It's going good so far. I spent most of my day with my friends but had some down time so I put money on horse racing too
Human 1:	 I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?
Human 2:	 It's been that long since I spent time with friends too but going deep sea fishing with some of them sounds like fun
Human 1:	 Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?
Human 2:	 I'm going fishing with friends once before Thanksgiving. It will be fun but stressful haha
Human 1:	 Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?
Human 2:	 I'm thinking about going deep sea fishing with some friends that weekend but its got me very nervous. Have you been before??
Human 1:	 New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?
Human 2:	 I have been there before but the city itself because that is far from family and its very busy. What about you?
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I have been there the city itself because that's far as well but you get over time. What about New York make you prefer Tokyo?
