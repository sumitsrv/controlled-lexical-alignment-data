Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I ran it time!
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 Yes, the marathon coming up very soon, but I think I need some time off in between.
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 It definitely takes some time and hard work - but not like any of the triathlons which are overly obstacle race's
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 Spartan race has over 100 obstacles you know and that's not including the marathon which is a 26 mile race
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 Oh okay, not for me then but fun for you and the likelihood of winning one next year is high
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 It's the one time you can workout for months and months but still not improve your physical appearance like training for a marathon for one night
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 Are you doing the spartan race in monterey? Its one of my all time favorite marathons
