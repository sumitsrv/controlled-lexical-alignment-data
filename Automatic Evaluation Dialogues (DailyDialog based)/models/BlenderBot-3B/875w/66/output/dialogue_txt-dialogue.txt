A|0| Human 1: hi 
B|1| Human 2: hello ! 
A|2| Human 1: _any_ improvements _in_ _your_ _marathon_ _time_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ ran _it_ [time] ! 
A|4| Human 1: [i] see . _are you_ planning to do _any_ sporting events _in_ _the_ _coming_ _months_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: yes , [the] [marathon] [coming] _up_ very soon , _but_ [i] think [i] need some [time] off [in] between . 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _like_ _doing_ _spartan race_ . _it's_ an _obstacle_ _race_ _which is_ challenging _but not_ overtly so _like_ _marathons_ _and_ _triathlons_ 
B|7| Human 2: _it_ definitely takes some [time] [and] hard work - [but not] [like] [any] _of_ [the] [triathlons] [which] [are] overly [obstacle] race's 
A|8| Human 1: [it] _has_ abt 20 _obstacles_ [like] crossing _high_ walls , monkey bars , etc . _its_ _fun_ 
B|9| Human 2: [spartan race] [has] over 100 [obstacles] [you] know [and] that's [not] including [the] [marathon] [which _is] a_ 26 mile [race] 
A|10| Human 1: wanna sign [up] _for_ _next_ _one_ _? its_ [in] february _in monterey_ 
B|11| Human 2: oh okay , [not] [for] me then [but] [fun] [for] [you] [and] [the] likelihood _of_ winning [one] [next] year [is] [high] 
A|12| Human 1: 1-2 _months_ [is a] good amount [of] [time] , if [you] _workout_ regularly . _it's_ [a] lot about [the] technique , [which] we _can_ practice [in] _training_ sessions . 
B|13| Human 2: [it's] [the] [one] [time] [you] [can] [workout] [for] [months] [and] [months] [but] still [not] improve [your] physical appearance [like] [training] [for] [a] [marathon] [for] [one] night 
A|14| Human 1: awesome ! there [is a] [training] ground [in] san jose . will coordinate with [you] [next] [time] we go [for] practice . 
B|15| Human 2: [are you] [doing] [the] [spartan race] [in monterey] [? its] [one] [of] my all [time] favorite [marathons]
