Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 I'm great. I was screaming because I had to help my girlfriend move in.
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm sad for you and helpless too! Have you been working hard for months.
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I'm sad for you that you lost some one! And angry at the situation and circumstance!
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I was lost and someone was pulling me out you got that one right!
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 It's been pretty tiring I'm trying to help out on the keto diet as well.
