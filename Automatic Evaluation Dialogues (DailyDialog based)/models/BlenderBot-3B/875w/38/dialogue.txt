Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 What do you think about human like chat bots?
Human 2:	 Whats up my friend! you like chat bots?
Human 1:	 Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
Human 2:	 the bots have made some progress over the last few years
Human 1:	 Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)
Human 2:	 the imperssination bot sounds far fetched like you have some great chat bots going out over there
Human 1:	 True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)
Human 2:	 Some are good and some funny from the start, like how about that time you have seen these bots over there?
Human 1:	 I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛
Human 2:	 The imperssination bot sounds like it will take over the world and that has some good points how can these AI even think they are better then
Human 1:	 The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂
Human 2:	 The imperssation bot has already been pretty good from the start. They can be very funny and will research many different topics for you also
Human 1:	 haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!
Human 2:	 hahah that is pretty funny, like how you think these bots would even know the difference from reality and the implications this will have.
