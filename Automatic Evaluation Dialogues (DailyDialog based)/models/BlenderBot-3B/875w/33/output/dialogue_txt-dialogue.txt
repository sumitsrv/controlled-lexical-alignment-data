B|5| Human 2: _i_ [make] [cookies] [but] they're [out] [of] kindness , [i'm trying to] _get_ [them] [to] [have] [enough] money saved up before christmas 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ thought , _thanks_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [good] [thanks [.] what] type [of cookies] are [you] [trying] [out] ? _is_ _it_ croissant ?

B|11| Human 2: [i think] [you] [make] [cookies] [too] [don't] [you] [with] [the] [all] [that] sweetener [but yeah] [i think] [people] [have] [to] [try] [them] [out] [next time] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] _last time_ [i] paid attention [to] [that] _sort of_ stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [made] [the] [cookies] [last time] [that] were [sort of] [sweet] [and] [when] [they] came [out] , [all the] [people] [was] in love [with] [them] . [the] fatty
