Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 It's great! I'm trying to finish all of the croissants that I make. Do you work on a Sunday?
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I make cookies but they're out of kindness, I'm trying to get them to have enough money saved up before christmas

Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?

Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I made the cookies last time that were sort of sweet and when they came out, all the people was in love with them. The fatty
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
