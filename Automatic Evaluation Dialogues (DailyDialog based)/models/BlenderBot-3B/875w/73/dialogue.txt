Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 going good just got in from my day job
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 I was good going to watch game too but it's getting late, I'm ready to head off to bed, How goes it on your part?
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I see them play basketball game sometimes at the Grizzlies arena.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I'd love going see the Grizzlies with some animal names! The team is naming them more animal-like these days
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 Haha yeah I see your point. The New York Grizzlies team was the original name.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 The Grizzlies original name was the New York Chairs, that's right!  I was about to correct you. Sounds more cool
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 What I'm saying is that the Grizzlies team name was cooler than the New York Chairs. The original names of all NBA
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Haha that's cool! I heard about the movie. A scary film called The Grizzlies was very interesting. It came out in 1995
