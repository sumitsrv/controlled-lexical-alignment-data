Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great, just watching a movie you know what its like to be single
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book, The Count of Monte Cristo and you are what doing?
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm doing good, how are you doing? ohh that book is the best classic novel like that have you read it before?
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I like reading books that have lots of characters but are very good too you read them often.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I like that book and have read it many times but in recent years the movie about Peter Thiel's papers are better than reading the book
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 I have read it, but like you the book about contrarian philosophy and for innovation also
Human 1:	 yup!
