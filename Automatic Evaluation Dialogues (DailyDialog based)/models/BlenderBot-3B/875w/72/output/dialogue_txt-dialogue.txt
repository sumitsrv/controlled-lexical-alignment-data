A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back _too_ much _on_ _things_ _, but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for me_ _in_ terms _of_ _time_ spent _with_ _family and_ _friends_ _and_ _work_ _life_ balance . why do [you] ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [have been very] _busy_ [with] [work] [and] [family] [too] [, but] [for] _some_ reason [things] feel quiet _this_ [time] [of] _year_ . 
A|4| Human 1: great ! good _idea_ _to_ _help_ _people_ figuring _out_ their _new year resolutions_ 🙂 _so_ _how_ do _i get_ a fresher outlook ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [i get] [you] [too] , [life] [and] [things] can _be_ [so] hectic [with] [work] [and] [family and] [people] _around_ [but] [new year resolutions] [help] 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we _practice_ _that_ ! [i] _think_ _the idea_ does [have] [some] potential . _how_ did [you] _come_ up [with] [this] _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: _that's_ [the] thing [you] [have] [to] [think] [for] yourself [and] _not_ [how] [people] see [things] 
A|8| Human 1: _thats_ great ! [this] _is_ valuable [help] [for] [the] community . [i] [think] _mental health_ _is_ one _of the_ bigger _challenges_ facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [thats] [the idea] [that] [come] [with] [time] [and] [practice] [for] [you] . [you] [have] [to] [think] [out] [of the] box [and] [how] [you] can [get] [people] [to] [have] more [health] 
A|10| Human 1: _that is_ _actually_ a quote stolen from my tl _when_ [i] joined my _first_ company _after graduation_ . [i] guess _now_ _after_ 5 yrs [of] [work] _experience_ , [i] fully agree [with] it 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [that is] [so] _true !_ [thats] [the] [first] [year] [after graduation] [for me] [when] [people] [have been] asking [and] [now] they [actually] [think] _about_ [that] . [this] resolution 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; [i] [think] [family and] _friends_ play a big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring [around] [with] [new] stuff 3 . multiple hobbies [that] keep [you] [busy] ... [so] _on_ 🙂 [what] [about] [you] ? [is] _there_ a _right_ answer [to] [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: [that] [and] [life] [experience] [that] [you] [may] [have] [with] [friends] or [family] who [have] [mental health] [challenges] [that] [may] [help] [you] [when] [the] [time] comes 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! _that's very thoughtful and_ spiritual 🙂 also music earned a spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's very thoughtful and] [right] [you] [have] [to] [think] [about] [the] future [now] 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am [actually] [not] much [of] a reader . [i] usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original _thoughts_ 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: [that's] [right] , [there] are [so] many [new] [challenges] [and] [new] [things] [in] [life] [that] [you] [may] [have] [not] thought [about] yet . what's your [thoughts] [on] 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! [true !] it [may] turn [out] [to] [be] a best seller :)
