Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 Hi where lots of different people come together to get together and meet one another.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 Maybe one where we get to meet lots of people and keep in touch for a long time. I just counted and it's 32 different people.
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia was one of them, I have heard that it is very different from America, do you think it is true?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 That's really fascinating and it would be hard coming from where you are but people seem very different.
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 I mean you are right, it's really fascinating and people from different cultures interact with one another.
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 it really was but what i mean is that people are very interesting and spooky. you never know where they will end up. 
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 Yea it's really interesting and you never really know what you are going to find.
