Human 2:	 I start the new year trying to unwind and relax. What about you?
Human 1:	 Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.
Human 2:	 Oddly enough when you used to catch them on the phone but don't do it much more? What changed?
Human 1:	 In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that’s why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?
Human 2:	 Have you seen the Pokémon show pikachu that just aired on the game? It's amazing.
Human 1:	 What is your favorite show to watch right now?

Human 1:	 I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.
