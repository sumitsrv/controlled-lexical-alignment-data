Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland is the best!  Christmas and Disneyland would be a wonderful trip for kids and you know it.
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 Disneyland and the resort around there would be fun for you?
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 the Christmas lights will probably be so beautiful and you might drive right by them for a little Christmas surprise!
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 Good idea that would probably work for the kids and not too much for the in laws!
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I think the Christmas lights would look so cool around that christmas eve in the city! but not sure about airbnb
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 What about for your kids you can take that time and they will enjoy this year.
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 We are getting the little niece everything that I wanted for Christmas this year.  Like crazy things you can not buy online at christmas time
