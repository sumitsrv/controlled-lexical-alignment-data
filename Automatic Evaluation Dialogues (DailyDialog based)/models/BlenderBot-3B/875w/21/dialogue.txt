Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well!  I just found out my dog has a UTI - I've had him for 7 years now so you think I
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm doing well. I hope you are feeling better about emails. I'm already in that position
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I enjoy doing work outside. it's what I'm paid for. you are a butcher?
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I do like movies but it's cool that you work outside. Are you a truck driver too?
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I like it but I work there for a month and never want to do that again. Terminators are awesome movies!
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 yea that's what work is like, it touching you but will never get there haha
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 No but it touching you will not get there that's the worst part. The ending is happy and the end never comes
