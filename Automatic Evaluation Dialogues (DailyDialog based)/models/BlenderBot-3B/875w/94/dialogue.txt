Human 2:	 Not yet, you?
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 I did and you know what? I had no idea it was so good until after.
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm having lunch. It's some chicken and vegetarian tacos for lunch
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I ate some fish and vegetarian buffet for lunch.

Human 2:	 I'm pretty sure you love them all and are thinking the same thing! They make you so happy to eat them though!  It is not for
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I have and it's the food for lunch too. What kind are you having?
