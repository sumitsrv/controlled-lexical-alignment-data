Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty busy and long, but it has been a long year. I work for a school system as a teacher
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 Just have fun trying to work the next couple of months before busy for the year.
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 Haha I like to work for the fun before break too! Do you have any plans for that?
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I just started the run for fun challenge you can find on the internet - not long distance though.  I've been trying to workout 5 days
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 haha I guess you just have so many plans that you run out of fun before the break is over
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 I have not run a marathon before but like long distance walking a lot, I bet you are excited for the next few days haha
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I have one every year. This year, run like the wind marathon- just like I did for half of them haha
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 I was just running one year ago and have been training like crazy for this year's marathon. How long have you been running for?
