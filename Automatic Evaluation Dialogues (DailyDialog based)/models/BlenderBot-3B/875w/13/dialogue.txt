Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Yes! The parasite that infects the human host to take advantage of their body's immune system?
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 The last movie I saw was Ratchet and Clank. Ever see one of those?
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 No I did you see the Mandalorian? The action and space film from Tomatoes? it's really great.
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 No I never have did you see the Marvels Ratchet and clank movie? Whats it about?
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I saw the Spiderman one haha and was too scared to watch other movies. Ratchet and Clank is an action hero video game
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I see. Tomatoes was good but not the scary one. You should watch that other Marvel and you might really like it too
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I've never seen the Marvel movies, and Spiderman was the best in my opinion. The actor that did the voice of Ratche
