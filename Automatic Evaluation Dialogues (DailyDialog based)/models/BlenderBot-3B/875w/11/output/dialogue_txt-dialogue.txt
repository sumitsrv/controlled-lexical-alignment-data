A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you have_ _a_ _favourite_ _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hey [you have] _to_ give me credit here . _the_ _flower is_ [a] hybrid _of_ [a] rose . but _i_ love [a] rose 
A|4| Human 1: i'm working on [a] theory . why _does_ [the] _lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] never heard [the] [flower] [lotus] _is_ [a] hybrid _of_ [the] rose 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ [a] personal theory . _i think that_ [flower] preferences _are more_ revealing [of] personality _than_ _people_ _appreciate ._ 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] [it's] [the] [flower] [that] [people] [are more] attracted [to] [than] [appreciate .] there [have] been [lotus] flowering plants in asia since at 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] _like_ [a] cartoon [flower] . as if _you drew_ "flower" _with_ [a] _crayon and_ _then_ it came [to] _life_ . 
B|9| Human 2: [the] [flower] [lotus] [and] [the] rose [are] quite _pretty_ , [i think] [you] [like] [it's] [that] way because its [not] [a] popular garden plant in 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone _what_ _their favourite_ [flower is] . [pretty] much [like] _what_ we _just_ did . _does_ [that] _make sense_ so far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i think that] [it's] [just] [the] [flower] [you drew] [with] [crayon and] [is] [like] [their favourite] thing in [life] , [what] [does] [not] [make sense] 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with] _the person_ _some_ [more] , [and] ask them _some_ [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] [sense] [of] _what they're_ [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [like] [the] [flower] [more] [with] vine [and] [not] [the person] _that's_ [what they're] [just] [some] [you] [are] [not] [people] [like] me [then] 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
