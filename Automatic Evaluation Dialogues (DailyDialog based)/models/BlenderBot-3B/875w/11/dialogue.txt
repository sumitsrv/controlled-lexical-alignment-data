Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 Hey you have to give me credit here.  The flower is a hybrid of a rose.  But I love a rose
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I have never heard the flower lotus is a hybrid of the rose
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I think it's the flower that people are more attracted to than appreciate. There have been lotus flowering plants in Asia since at
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 The flower lotus and the rose are quite pretty, I think you like it's that way because its not a popular garden plant in
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 I think that it's just the flower you drew with crayon and is like their favourite thing in life, what does not make sense
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 I like the flower more with vine and not the person that's what they're just some you are not people like me then
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
