Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty great! What game is it?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I'm great. It's about that for you as well but credit is still very kind of you taking the time to do this for others who won
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I'm just taking a game that's on my list for a very long time to win
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I like racquetball but I suck at that game for some reason. What's your favourite game with ping pong ball?
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I like racquetball but i get frustrated with just about every game that involves hitting a ball with a cage, I'm not
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 I really don't think that it's for you.  It's like tennis with no net and you get to hit balls into cage
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
