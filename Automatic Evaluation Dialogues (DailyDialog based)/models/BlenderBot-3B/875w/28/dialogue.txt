Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I'm great just listening to the breakfast album right now which is always a good way to start the day 
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I just had breakfast and am about to start the day right off too. Do your hash browns have eggs in them?
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat one hash brown every day and always over easy that's the only way you could live forever
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I'm afraid not that would be the only food you could eat and want forever which isn't right, what's your other question?
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 I love that question. Soylent would be my answer! I have only had the original though - what's your favorite flavor?
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 I'm just wondering would you like food forever or to eat the same one thing forever?  What's your other question?
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
