A|8| Human 1: yeah , turning orange _would be_ [a] drawback ! _that_ turns _my_ mind [to] nutrition so [i] suddenly _want_ [to] say _soylent_ _or_ [one] of those _other_ "complete foods" , [which] [i] think defeats [the] purpose of [the] _question ._ [i'm] [in] [a] muddle !

B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [just] wondering [would] [you] [like] [food forever] [or] [to] [eat] [the] same [one] thing [forever] ? what's [your] [other] [question] ? 
A|14| Human 1: oh , [too] [easy] ! try [the] green hut , they [have] franchises everywhere . all their [food] [is] green [and] [the] plates [are] green [too .]
