Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I pondered this scenario as well. I need someone to help me.
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 not all are like that though the other person used their friendship with you for personal gain
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 Okay I have not been able to hang with friends for the last couple of years because we are all older like you.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I feel the same way though now everyone from that circles all friends have their own reasons for not inviting me, they are like its because A
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 I have to find the way to balance with it because it's always good for friendship but they say if someone is never there that means they are
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm in the same boat. It's always good for me because it means they like me but never ask me to hang out and that makes me
