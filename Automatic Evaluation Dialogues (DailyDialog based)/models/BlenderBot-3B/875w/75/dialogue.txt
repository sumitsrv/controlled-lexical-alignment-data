Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 It's possible you have met me before. I used the screen in the meeting where I did work for them last month? Maybe I don't recall
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 Did you dance in the middle east, where it's always crazy?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 Oh you met the guy who's hair I stole from you for some reason? Lol. It was a good schwasty dance, I am
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm a cardiologist too. That's pretty neat. You have any dance moves you'd like to share? 
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what that's either, but you know, the Palo Alto dance practice. You have heard of it?
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I am not sure but that's what it looks like you do, but it's not a real job.
