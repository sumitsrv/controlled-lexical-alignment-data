A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! _what_ _about_ _you ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: hey [superman] ... whats [the] craziest superhero [you] _can_ think of 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible ._ [you] _won't see_ me . 
B|5| Human 2: [i] [won't see] [you ?] [what] _is_ [invisible] [about] [superman] ? [you] must be [the] aluminum man ! 
A|6| Human 1: _i would rather _trust_ fmri_ _and_ _machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an _expert_ _on_ _that ._ sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i would] [trust fmri] [for] [the] [machine learning] [and] [superman] [that] [you] [not] [see] [rather] [invisible] 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain imaging_ thing [that] _can tell you_ _a_ _brain's activity_ _at_ _a_ _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [i would rather trust] [the] [expert] that's [not] [invisible .] [the brain] can't [see] [you] , but [this] [machine] might [tell] [it] [for] some reason . 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _believe_ in _science_ ! _science_ [is] my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: that's [not] true , [for] [fmri] [imaging] [you] [can] [see] [the brain] [activity] [and] that's [pretty] cool . [the brain] [is] [a] cool organ 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ bad _at science_ . [what] [can] _science_ do ? [is] [it] _the most_ important thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [science] [can tell you] [that] [the brain imaging] thingy [can] [see] what's going [on] [for] [pretty] much anything [i would] [believe] [that .] 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make sense_ ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [pretty] good [at science] [for] [the most] part . [the] [brain's activity] [can] [make sense] when [you] [see] what's going [on] inside of [it] .
