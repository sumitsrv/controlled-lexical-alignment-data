Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 Hey superman... Whats the craziest superhero you can think of
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 I won't see you? What is invisible about superman? You must be the aluminum man!
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 I would trust fMRI for the machine learning and superman that you not see rather invisible
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 I would rather trust the expert that's not invisible. The brain can't see you, but this machine might tell it for some reason.
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 That's not true, for fMRI imaging you can see the brain activity and that's pretty cool. The brain is a cool organ
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 Science can tell you that the brain imaging thingy can see what's going on for pretty much anything I would believe that.
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I'm pretty good at Science for the most part. The brain's activity can make sense when you see what's going on inside of it.
