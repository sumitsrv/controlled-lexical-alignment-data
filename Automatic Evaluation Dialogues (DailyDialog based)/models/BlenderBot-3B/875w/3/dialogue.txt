Human 2:	 It raining pretty bad today but my friend was able to ride his bicycle to the station.

Human 2:	 Where I grew up had too much rain this year that water started pouring from the sky early today. I like the days when it's glo
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 Haha that is pretty funny that the water started raining early this year for you. Where is that?
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 That's never fun but here there is that water in the river near me too. Haha people say this year can't get any worse lol.
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 Haha. Where did you grow up? It was interesting that there have been rains this early here too but the drought hasn't been as bad
