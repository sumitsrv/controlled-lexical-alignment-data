Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Nothing much you! You know how it is! Just got back from my first trip to the park since new years and I cant stop thinking about all
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 wow you last time was this year! how was the holiday?
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 it was fun last time. the friend and i had been long gone
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh it was this summer. But recently he had a really stressful life so he's been working long hours and I haven't seen him much.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Oh really?  I wish sometimes but it was more work for the most part. The time away is exciting but pretty routine as well. 
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 that sounds like your life is pretty routine and you have the time but want more adventures! I know how that goes for sure, it is fun
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 What does bull riding look like? I have never really been in that kind of crowd but it sounds pretty exciting for a Saturday
