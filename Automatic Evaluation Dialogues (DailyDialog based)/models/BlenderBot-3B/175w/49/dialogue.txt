Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Its going well so far, how about you?
Human 1:	 Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?
Human 2:	 It is going fine thanks for asking. Just working on the weekend you know.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?
Human 2:	 I'll be watching on the weekend.  Can you believe I live in the same town as Tom Cruise?
Human 1:	 Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha
Human 2:	 Wow. He's the main reason I watch Hokey actually haha. What are you going to do tonight
Human 1:	 You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!
Human 2:	 I have never seen the UFC before. Are you going to watch this weekend's fight?
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I am a pretty big MMA fan but have never been able to get into UFC myself!  It's a little too violent.  Do
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 Yeah I will. It's one of my favourite MMA matches that's just coming up. I actually train and am competing in the UFC
