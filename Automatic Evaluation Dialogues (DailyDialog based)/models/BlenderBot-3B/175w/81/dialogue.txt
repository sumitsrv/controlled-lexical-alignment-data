Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How have you been
Human 1:	 great! just came back from a ski trip
Human 2:	 I am just relaxing after spending a week at the beach
Human 1:	 I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Human 2:	 I did that once, and I slammed my head real hard.  I got a black eye.
Human 1:	 Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
Human 2:	 Hey that sounds like you got a concussion.  I know a little french but I don't use it much, most people around here
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 I know very little french but most of the locals spoke english. It was really cool!
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I wanted to go to Quebec city but I could not get the time off with my friends. I was going to watch the Olymp
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I wanted too but don't think my work would approve. I can't imagine how cool that would be.
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 you don't know french that good i can call the other girl to translate what is your favorite sport and the olympics
Human 1:	 Okay! It was nice talking to you
