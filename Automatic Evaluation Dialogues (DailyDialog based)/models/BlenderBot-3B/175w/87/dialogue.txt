Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm great! I'm just doing some homework and you
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm doing alright. Trying not to be lazy on the couch and reading some of my book
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I'm better. I love coffee and a good book. I like reading the ones that help you sleep. Which book are you reading?
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I'm reading "Waiting for God." It does have some good tips and it's better read than it seems like but it is long.
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I like Peter Thiel's books and that book is one of his most recent works. He is also the creator of Wikimed
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 I like to read the book called "Waiting for God". It's about Christian philosophy and it is very useful.
Human 1:	 yup!
