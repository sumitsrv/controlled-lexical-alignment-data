Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good. How are you doing today?
Human 2:	 I'm good. I have had to eat today so I'm looking forward to tonight's game. How are you?
Human 1:	 I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?
Human 2:	 I'm great! Just finishing a good meal, was for lunch today, the last one for awhile, have you eaten yet today?
Human 1:	 Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!
Human 2:	 I've not today but we are doing seafood for dinner tonight. What did you have for lunch today?
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Is it hard?
Human 2:	 What a great day! I had a nice salad. How was your day?
Human 1:	 Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?
Human 2:	 I have done this before, but it was for a different reason.
Human 1:	 haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?
Human 2:	 I like hunting for seafood, especially when it is the only thing I have to eat!
Human 1:	 Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?
Human 2:	 My outdoorsy type person would have the perfect day on the beach.
