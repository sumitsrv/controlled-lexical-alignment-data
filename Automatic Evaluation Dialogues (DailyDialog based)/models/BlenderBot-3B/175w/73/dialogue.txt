Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Great day and your's?  My cat is sitting next to me purring
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 I think it's getting worse, I've been having headaches for 2 weeks now
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I'm going to the game tomorrow.  Grizzly are one my favourite teams.
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I'm going with some friends to see the game, well, not all together, but we are going to the game. Who knows, something could
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 I know right? The name makes me cringe, but I'll still see them play. Who's your team?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 I'd be surprised of that name if I were you!  What about you?
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 I'm going with some friends also, it's the nickname that my moms boyfriend came up with for me haha. What about you?
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 I saw about that movie once called The Circle I think the one that was a movie in 1984 with a dystopian future
