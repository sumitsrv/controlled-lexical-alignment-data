Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 Pretty good. I just got done going to the doctor because my foot hurts. Do you have the day off?
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I'm so lucky. I love reading the news and this is going to be my first day off since I've been promoted.
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I've been off work all day and I'm relaxing with a nice glass of wine. How about you?
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 I do have off work today and I am looking forward to the world cup starting up!
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would love to go to all the places and see the world. I've been saving for it for about 4 years.
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 I'm saving all the money I can to fly to Australia after that dive trip.  I would love to see your favorite places there.
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 That's a great idea! What will you do while you're there?
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 That's too bad. You should get some more money to go see some places you like to when you can. It would be amazing to see with
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
