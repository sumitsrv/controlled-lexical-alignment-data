Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm sad too about not catching mine that I had left on the street!
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I've done some catfood and treating her, she just howls all day with no response
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I'd probably take her to the beach. I've been going for many years and it would be great to take her where I could go anywhere
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would want her to go to a place like southeast Asia where there is so much rain and the weather fluctuates
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I would probably go somewhere where I could just take an epic canoe trip for the day.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 Do you want her to have one and go alone or will you do it with somebody? 
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 I've never been ziplining and I wouldn't mind trying one day.
