Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I'm great and ready for the weekend?
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm okay. It is getting cold. Seville is near where my grandparents live, do you live in Spain?
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 I'm sure you are feeling great to have done something you were ready for
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I have done some extreme sports before but not Seville, where is it located?
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I'm from Spain. I used to ski a lot in the mountains near Sevilla, now I am getting older and it is
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I haven't but I have tried rafting, the water skiing and wakeboarding.
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
