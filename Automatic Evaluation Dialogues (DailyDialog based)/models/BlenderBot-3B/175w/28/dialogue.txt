Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.
Human 2:	 I just ate too, thanks. Its always great to eat breakfast right to wake up!
Human 1:	 I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!
Human 2:	 I'm doing great, had breakfast and just ate some eggs and rice, thanks for asking! Way healthier than your breakfast.
Human 1:	 Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?
Human 2:	 I would eat pizza, what's your favorite food?
Human 1:	 Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other "complete foods", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!
Human 2:	 I'm the same way. I could eat just one food forever and it would be a good one. But for me, the breakfast that I had
Human 1:	 BRILLIANT. I love it.
Human 2:	 Soylent Green. I think that would probably be the one for me. I love the movie!
Human 1:	 That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?
Human 2:	 Yeah the Soylent green would be great! I love it. I want to feel like I'm eating food and have no health consequences
Human 1:	 Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.
