Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	 Just finished eating dinner. I had a great salad, chicken and broccoli.
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	 Just finished dinner myself, but it was a good one! Do yo have anything you are up to today?
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 I am so cool that you went on a roller coaster and had an awesome day! I'm just relaxing today after having some bad food
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Wow that was cool, I am actually going on a roller coaster today too and I am nervous. I don't want any injuries.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 I have not but it looks interesting!  What was scary about it?
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I like roller coasters. but i'm not that good at riding them. the first thing I did was run from one. 
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 Oh you did the first time? I guess that's not that bad. The coaster was too much for me but it has some g-for
