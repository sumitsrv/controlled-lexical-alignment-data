Human 1:	 that's too bad hopefully with practice it'll get better what about the doggy paddle haha
Human 2:	 I had the hardest time paddling with that thing. I got too close the the other doggy and it bit off my finger. 
Human 1:	 Corgi belly flop COMPILATION - cute funny dogs Corgi Flop <REDACTED_LINK>
Human 2:	 Well I am better now, but it's good to get that out of the way. That's funny that Corgi's do that haha.
Human 1:	 from a high enough distance, yes?
Human 2:	 Corgis are funny dogs, but with those short legs, it's hard to paddle the canoe with them
Human 1:	 no so far sadly you? a relative is coming to visit for thanksgiving though
Human 2:	 haha, yes i've seen some funny videos of that  The name originates from the Anglo-Scottish corgi,
Human 1:	 that's still pretty fun are you going to cook the turkey yourself?
