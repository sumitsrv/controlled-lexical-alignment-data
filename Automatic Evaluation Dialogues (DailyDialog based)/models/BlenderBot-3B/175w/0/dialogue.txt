Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 I like christmas the one where people get together get gifts and decorate.
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 The 25th day of the year where I like to keep my count, that's a nice one too
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia was one of my favorite holidays in the past, I think I will go back.
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 Yeah it's really cool! Australia was founded by English colonists and then settled by people from the Indigenous Peop
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 Not really what? Are you going to go back?
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 Yes, and there's a lot of really amazing history to it.  The history goes back 2.5 million years!
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 I do and I was surprised by how much there still is there.  I've been to the areas in Papua New Guinea
