A|4| Human 1: whoa ! looking forward _to_ _listening_ _to_ it _. what_ softewares [you] _use_ _for_ it ? 
B|5| Human 2: its [going] great thanks [for] asking ! so [how] old where [you] when [you] started [listening] ? _i_ [use] _a_ lot _of_ [the] _music_ from [the] 80's 
A|6| Human 1: oh cool ! _what_ sort [of] [music] _do_ [you] compose ? 
B|7| Human 2: _i_ started when _i_ was 18 , but _i_ stopped composing [music] because _i_ _just_ wasn't doing too _well ._ 
A|8| Human 1: _nice_ .... _you are_ [a] rockstar ! 😉 
B|9| Human 2: [nice] . [you are] very young , _i_ was _in_ _my_ mid-twenties when _i_ started 
A|10| Human 1: yeah .... [i] _play_ bit [of] _guitar_ . [just] got [my] first monitor this week 
B|11| Human 2: [i] am _in_ [my] early 30s and [play] [guitar] as _well_ as [music] from other instruments and have been _for a_ while [. what] [are] [you] [going] [to] 
A|12| Human 1: _yes_ , [the] bar _chords are_ [the] worst . it took _me_ several months [to] [play] _them_ [well _.] i_ still _can't_ [play] _them_ [for a] long time though 
B|13| Human 2: [just] [chords are] tough [for] [me] right now [. i] _can_ [play] [the] [guitar] [well] enough but [just] [can't] barre [them] . 
A|14| Human 1: that's true . [it's] like [the] alphabets [in] [a] language . once [you] know [them] , [you] [can] _pretty_ much write word 
B|15| Human 2: [yes] [the] strumming barre [chords] [can] be [pretty] difficult [to] [do] [for] anyone
