Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	 It's going well so far, how about you?
Human 1:	 Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?
Human 2:	 Its going great thanks for asking!  So how old where you when you started listening?  I use a lot of the music from the 80's
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	 I started when I was 18, but I stopped composing music because I just wasn't doing too well.
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	 Nice. you are very young, I was in my mid-twenties when I started
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 I am in my early 30s and play guitar as well as music from other instruments and have been for a while. What are you going to
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 Just chords are tough for me right now. I can play the guitar well enough but just can't barre them.
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 yes the strumming barre chords can be pretty difficult to do for anyone
