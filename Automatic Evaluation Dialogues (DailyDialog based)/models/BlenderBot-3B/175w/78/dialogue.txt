Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 I love to cook and I just love pastry, it is such a great way to use dairy products.
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 Oh wow that is so cool! I'm so happy you said that because I want to be an pastry chef as well! I was wondering
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I was just a bit of psychic and the guess that you might be good at cooking.  
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 That was the best cake I have ever tasted and that is a fact!  I love chewing and chewed all the time and was
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I have a favorite that I make all the time because it is easy and quick to make.    What are you eating?
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 I work in an office.  What is your favorite cake recipe?  Mine is the vanilla icing and buttercream one that's
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I like the cakes with a lot of icing and very sweet frosting
