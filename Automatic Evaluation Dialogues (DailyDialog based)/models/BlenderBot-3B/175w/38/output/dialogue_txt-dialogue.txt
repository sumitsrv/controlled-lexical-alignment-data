A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ _do_ _you think_ about human _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: they're okay _. they_ [chat] _on the_ internet , but [you] _have_ _to_ _be_ really attentive _to_ them for _some_ odd reasons . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to _have_ made_ [some] _great progress over_ last few _years_ . _do_ _you _think_ the_ positives outweigh [the] negatives 
B|5| Human 2: well , _they_ [have made] [great progress over] [the] [years] but [some] _are_ still _a_ bit creepy . 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though it _sounds_ far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: [like chat bots] _that_ [have] [some] kind _of_ speech impediment ? 
A|8| Human 1: _true_ [that] ! [some] [of] these _bots _are_ very_ _engaging and funny_ [. _they] _are_ now_ _good at_ _even_ sarcasm _i_ wonder _how_ far [are] we from [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [engaging and funny] because [they] [have] _a_ [bots] [that] _can_ [do] things [like] give [you] tips [how] [to] [do] [the] homework [you] forgot , [even] 
A|10| Human 1: _i think_ it [can] take _many_ _different_ forms as [a] product _. the_ research implication is also huge ! it _will_ signify [how] _ai_ research _has_ progressed so far [and] _better_ place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort [of] [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 _i_ might [be] overselling it here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i [think] the] [ai] [has] advanced [to] [that] point [. the] [bots [are] now] able [to have] [many] conversations [on] [different] topics [and] [can] [even] [better] understand 
A|12| Human 1: [the] current auto-suggestions already [do] pretty _good_ 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: that's [true] [and] [some] [are] [more] intuitive [and] [good at] picking up [on] your voice or [the] way [you] speak . [some] [even] [can] help [you] _with_ 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty far fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation [with] [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: hahaha [you] [are very] [funny] , but [that] [sounds] [like] [a] [good] idea . [what] [will] [you think] [of] when [the] [ai] comes up [with] [this] technology ?
