B|15| Human 2: [i was] [very] [torn between] [the] two [too] [but] [i just] [like] [that] [christmas tree] smell [and] decorating [it] [for the holidays] [too] much . 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store [is] target , plus they often [have] good deals . 
B|17| Human 2: [i was torn] [the] entire [month] [between] [christmas] [and] new year's [day] [, but] [we] decided [to] go [with] [the] [real] _tree ._ its [not] [that] [bad] 
A|18| Human 1: great , [i] [hope] [you] find [a] nice [tree .]
