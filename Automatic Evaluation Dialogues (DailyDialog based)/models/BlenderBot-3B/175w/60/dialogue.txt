Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's okay, I guess. I was hoping for a vacation day off tomorrow, but instead I go in for my shift tomorrow. How is it
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 My day was great! I went out rock climbing too and loved it! It was the first weekend in a while I really went out and enjoyed
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 I was watching some movie about the rock climbing scene in a horror movie! It was good.
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 that's very nice! what kind of movie was it? I'm not much of a movie person, but I think the one that came out recently
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 How fun! I was out climbing the same day and it was really exhilarating
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 yes! I was very frightened when I watched it the other night.  But i like scary movies.
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 Ahh you should see the southern lights! I saw some from the top of a mountain once on a climbing trip, it was so fun
