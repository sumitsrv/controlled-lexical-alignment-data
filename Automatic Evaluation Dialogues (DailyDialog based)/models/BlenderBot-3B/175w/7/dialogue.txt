Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 I don't have a favorite but what's weird is, I watched it the other day and realized the movie came out when I was 15. So
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 That's a good movie. Avatar came out way back when it was the best-selling movie in America
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 I like movies that are set in space!
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 I have heard people like it a lot, it is the most successful animated feature to come out in North America.
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 I like to eat anything and everything.  What's your favorite food?  I like pizza, it's my favorite comfort food.
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 I like homemade tomato soup and also some chinese food.
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 I like baking! I love to bake and cook for my family and friends.
