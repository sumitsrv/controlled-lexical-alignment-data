B|3| Human 2: [i'm] [great] [thanks] _, i_ just got in from shopping _, i_ love croquettes _and_ [i'm trying [to] make] my own 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done them_ once or twice _so_ far , _but_ _they_ _haven't_ _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm trying to] figure out why _. what kind_ _of_ _cookies_ _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: [i've] [made] _a_ few [croissants] [but] [haven't] [done them] in quite _a_ bit . are [you] [trying [to] make] [them] _with_ [flakey] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , [thanks] ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm trying] . [they] [have] [been] tough [to make] [but] [i'm] getting _the_ hang [of] _it [._ what kind] were [they] ? 
A|8| Human 1: now _that_ is [a] good idea . i'll give [it] [a] _try_ next _time_ . would [you] say _you _have_ a sweet tooth_ ?

B|11| Human 2: [i think] [i] [have a sweet tooth] [that] can't be satisfied [with] [the] [cookies] [i] [eat] sometimes . [but] [you] know [all] [people] [get] those cra 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! _the last time i_ paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ _when_ <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy _stomach_ upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] do [too] [and] [that] [was] [the last time i] ate sugar . [it] messed [with] my [stomach] . [so] [when] [i] [try] [to make] [sweet] potato fries 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] [not] feel guilty 🙂
