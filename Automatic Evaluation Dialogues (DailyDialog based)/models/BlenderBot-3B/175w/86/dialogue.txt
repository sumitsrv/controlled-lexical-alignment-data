Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Morning! How are you?
Human 1:	 I am doing well. Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Human 2:	 I have plans tonight to get my hair done for the holidays.
Human 1:	 I don't have any special plans. I will just stay at home with my family. How come you have to work on Christmas?
Human 2:	 I just have to work for the money! I don't like doing that, I will stay home with my family too.
Human 1:	 I see. Where did you go?
Human 2:	 I did not have any special plans. I will just stay home with the family. Where are you headed?
Human 1:	 I have not. I have only been to Uganda in Africa.
Human 2:	 Uganda is beautiful! I have been there for work a few times.  Where is home for you?
Human 1:	 I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.
Human 2:	 I have traveled around a lot myself. We have been all over and see some great stuff but I think it was just last year we went to
Human 1:	 No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.
Human 2:	 I see! Where was the volunteer project? I hope you had a great time. I have been all over Europe and to the Carib
Human 1:	 It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.
Human 2:	 I was just volunteering with the local church's soup kitchen! I have traveled all over since then but Uganda was my first
Human 1:	 Yes, I grew up in Germany.
