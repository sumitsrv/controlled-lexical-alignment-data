Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 Sure, that would be nice! Would I need to volunteer for a week?
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 Oh yes, that sounds like fun. Do you have the time available? I could volunteer for you.
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 That would be great! I will need you to send any and all details to this email for the event
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 Yes I have some time. And you can come as early as the first day of the event if needed.
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 I can start next sunday, the 21st.
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 Ok, how about next saturday the 20th? It will be a week long event. What do you need to know from me so I can
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 Sounds great. I can add you to the group chat on whatsapp and we will have a great time in the park.
Human 1:	 Thanks.
