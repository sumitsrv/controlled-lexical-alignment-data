Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 I have been thinking of starting a flower farm, I would be able to grow them in an orchard!
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I do have a favorite flower: the lotus. It is a shrub, orb and tree planting and cultivating is one
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I think that's cool. It's a pretty popular flower and it is a beautiful and pretty complex plant.
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 I like lotus too. It's a flower that is found most widely in Asia and Southeast asia.
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 that's cool, what makes it your favourite? I like rose bushes the most
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 the more you know lol  and yea that make sense  what about it did you like?
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
