A|4| Human 1: i'm working on [a] theory . why does _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [do] [have a] favorite flower: [the lotus] . _it_ _is_ [a] shrub , orb _and_ tree planting _and_ cultivating _is_ one 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ not research ! just [a] personal theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences are _more_ revealing [of] personality than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i think] _that's_ _cool _._ it's_ [a] _pretty_ popular [flower] _and_ _it_ _is_ [a] beautiful _and_ _pretty_ complex plant .
