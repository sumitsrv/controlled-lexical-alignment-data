Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just bored and looking at what some people are doing. What have you got goin on?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 Just chatting to the people here. Its fun.  How about yourself?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 Yeah it's quite relaxing but i have to say the health issues from smoking are very scary haha
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 You only live once, but it's good to do it healthly haha. I like cigars, which taste very strong sometimes.
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 You only live once but you can get your life pretty ruined.
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 I do believe that but not until after death. I would just like to live for a good while longer.
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 That would be nice, yes, but not much information on that so far.  A lot of theories.   Do you think it will
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
