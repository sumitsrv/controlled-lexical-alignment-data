Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you doing!
Human 1:	 I'm doing well. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, but its so dark outside!
Human 1:	 wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago
Human 2:	 I'm well. What are you cleaning up? I already finished!
Human 1:	 yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?
Human 2:	 I work outside, doing what I like, but it's pretty dirty in the winter here already, so I'm ready for Spring.
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you like action movies?
Human 2:	 I like watching movies that are action, adventure, and horror. My favorite is the new Jurassic Park movie.
Human 1:	 what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one
Human 2:	 I never watched it. I am not good with movies that have full on violence like that one that happened in 92
Human 1:	 haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end
Human 2:	 the time will come that you do it, it's so worth the watch, but it is a long one.
Human 1:	 oh no, so it's not happy ending?
Human 2:	 I get that. It's a pretty long one haha. But it's very intense when it gets to the end.
Human 1:	 then I want to watch it! you didn't spoil much 🙂
Human 2:	 Its one that I want to watch but I just cannot bring myself to. I know it will not end well. So much violence and destruction!
Human 1:	 Thanks!
