Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	 I love Thanksgiving especially when you get home for the holidays
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	 I have not got much plans because my family are a good distance from me now that I moved. How about you?
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 It's cold here too. I'm thankful for my family this year but sad I really want to go to the beach!
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 It's just one of the many conferences that I go to for food.
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 It is for the World's Fair. It was really cool and a lot people came all over the world.
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It's a conference for the company I work for, I don't have any other reason to go other than to meet some people and network.
