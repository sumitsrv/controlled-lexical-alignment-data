Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 Well pingpong is great. I love table tennis just as much as you.
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I just won a pingpong game too but it was kind of lame that's why I'm on reddit
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I love table tennis! What kind of game did you win?  It's been years for me but I'm just starting to get back
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I like playing the game of table tennis that involves hitting a ball with a racket and hitting it over all the racquet
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I used to play some as a child, hitting with a racquet is very physical! it's like tennis but you use sticks
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 I don't think it's physical so much as skillful and mental. It's a sport that requires creativity.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
