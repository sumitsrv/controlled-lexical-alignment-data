Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Its going alright, a little chilly out
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 I hope you don't have to ride a moped and are going to a shop to get the repairs fixed. 
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 Oh that's no good, did the mechanic find out which part is broke?
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Sure, but I won't pick you up if your going the other way.
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Yeah that would be fine, don't think this guy's going anywhere today lol
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Hahahaha you better have faith in the warriors game. The Warriors won, but they were so good that it was a great win.
