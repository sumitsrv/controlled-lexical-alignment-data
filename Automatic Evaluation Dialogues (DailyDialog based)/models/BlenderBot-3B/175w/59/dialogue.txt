Human 2:	 Hello, how is your day?
Human 1:	 It's good. It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?
Human 2:	 It's been a long week. It rained all day but my kids are happy about it, because we went swimming.
Human 1:	 I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?

Human 1:	 It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?
Human 2:	 I have heard about that series, but haven't read it yet -- it's been a while, and the sci-fi genre in
Human 1:	 Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?
Human 2:	 It's a great book and I highly recommend you read it. It's about alien lifeforms on a planet called Roswell. 
Human 1:	 The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn
Human 2:	 I'm not that much into sci-fi. But I heard The Expanse was pretty interesting. It's about virtual reality in
Human 1:	 There are other twists as well, so I haven't spoiled the whole thing! To be honest I am not a fan of spoilers
Human 2:	 Yes I want you to spoil it please! I just know the aliens are real and that humans are actually on the other planet, lol
