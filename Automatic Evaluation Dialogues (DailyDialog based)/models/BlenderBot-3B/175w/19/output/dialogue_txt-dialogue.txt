A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman_ ! _what_ _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] have been trying _to_ get into [the] mind of [superman] , so [you] have _a_ great day 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . _you won't see_ _me ._ 
B|5| Human 2: [i] have been [superman] [the] whole time but [you won't see] _my_ [invisible] face . 
A|6| Human 1: [i] would rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do _this_ . [i] [am] _not_ an expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: that's [not] [that] great because [the] [fmri and machine learning] doesn't work [for] [invisible] creatures 
A|8| Human 1: [the] _brain imaging_ thing [that] _can tell you_ _a brain's activity_ _at_ [a] _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [what] ? it's just [that] [you] [can tell] [a] lot [about] [a brain's activity] by [the] shape [and] composition of its reservoirs , 
A|10| Human 1: _i believe in_ _science_ ! _science_ _is_ [my] god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [the] fact [that] [you] are [not] [a] scientist [and] are [not] able [to] understand [what] [this] means [is] [pretty] funny _. what_ [is] [a] [brain imaging] [machine] ? 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ bad _at_ _science_ [. what] [can] _science_ do ? [is] _it_ [the] most _important_ thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [can tell you] [that] [i believe in] [the] [science] of mind , it's very [important] [for] [me .] [it] [is] [what] separates us human beings 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] make sense ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [not] good [at] [it] either . [science] [can] be useful [for] [a] multitude of things , including biochemistry [in] many things like medic
