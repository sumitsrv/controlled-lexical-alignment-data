Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 I'm great. Just watching some old school reruns, you?
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 I was just playing some football last night and this friend came over and had the time of his life. 
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 it was a long time! but im feeling like this is the best time!
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Yeah! Its been like 2 years. I have been really struggling with life recently..but this friend has cheered me up more than anything.
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Oh, I like it for the time being. I am hoping it can be more exciting.
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 It really was exciting. The bull was like a little puppy that kept following me around. I love animals and it was just so sweet
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 That sounds like such a fun time I'd love that but I have no friends who want to do it with me.
