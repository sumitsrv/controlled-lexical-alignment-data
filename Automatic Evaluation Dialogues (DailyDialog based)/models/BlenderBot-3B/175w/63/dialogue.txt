Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Disneyland would be the best trip for kids, you have fun
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 That sounds fun but we have heard nothing but good things about the resort and plan on heading there for the Christmas trip. 
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 I would love to! It is my plan for the Christmas holidays as well.
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 I would love that as well the Christmas markets are amazing and the food is to die for
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 I think you can use Airbnb in the area but not sure about for the Christmas market. I would also love that!
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 Sure can you take that, would you like me to look for one?
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 I am thinking about getting a couple of christmases for my son and maybe some toys too. The store has everything you need to entertain your
