Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 How's your day going?
Human 1:	 Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
Human 2:	 Pretty busy with work for sure. Do you know anything about the Civil Cases Act?
Human 1:	 A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?
Human 2:	 I have plans for the break, but I am trying to finish work before you so we can meet
Human 1:	 Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
Human 2:	 I like to bake for fun. what about you?
Human 1:	 cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
Human 2:	 I like to run for fun also.  I have to get up in the morning before I get up for my kids school. 
Human 1:	 haha
Human 2:	 I'm not much for long distances. But it's cool you are getting out. I've just started getting back in shape.
Human 1:	 I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
Human 2:	 that sounds awesome, I've not run a marathon yet, what type have you run and did you like it
Human 1:	 No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Human 2:	 I have run half marathons before but this one in particular was my longest. It took so much work!
Human 1:	 Two days ago. It was a tough one.
Human 2:	 I've just started too! I was so exhausted this morning and didn't run the marathon-only half one!
