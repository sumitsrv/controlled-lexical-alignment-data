Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 That's tough one. I would have to say pizza would be my top. What about you?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 I love pizza too! There's something about cream and cheese covered in sauce and bread that is amazing!
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 That's tough too.  The thing about ice cream is you can put so many things on top and it would still be good like chocolate, van
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 Very true and the variations you can have with ice cream are great, like mint chocolate chip
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 Yes! and they have been around the world for thousands of years. That is interesting. What's your favorite?
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 I think there's something afterlife, I just have no idea what. What about you?
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
