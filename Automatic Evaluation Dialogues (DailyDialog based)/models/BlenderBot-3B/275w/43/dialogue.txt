Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 I am the mentor, and you are a student this time, what would you like me to tell you?
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 Hey! That would be really helpful, you are the mentor?
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 That would be great, you are a good mentor then :)
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 Yes 1:1 mentorship is good. It allows you to have time to learn the material but is also good for them to learn your approach
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 Yes I prefer 1:1 mentorship as well, but it is good to have the other perspective sometimes!  
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 Very true, mentorship is very useful but sometimes you get stuck with somebody who doesn't know what to do.
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
