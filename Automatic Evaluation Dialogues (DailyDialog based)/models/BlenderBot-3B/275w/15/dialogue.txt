Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?
Human 2:	 Pretty good! My friend invited me to his birthday party and my head is going crazy. I am so excited though because he is getting married soon
Human 1:	 oh... sorry to hear that. But after that it will be a hard earned vacation
Human 2:	 I bet you will not be home for Christmas because that is when everything tends to go crazy
Human 1:	 I have some tentative plans, but if that doesn't pan out, will just chill at home.
Human 2:	 that will be hard but it is good you have some tentative plans just in case things doesn't pan out
Human 1:	 Where are you based out of these days?
Human 2:	 They are based out of Florida but just have a lot of tentative things left to do!
Human 1:	 San Francisco. It's been raining cats and dogs here since last 2-3 weeks
Human 2:	 It's been raining here too and some snow. I have been home most days. I will return to work soon but I just hate not being
Human 1:	 The flu has been hitting hard as well. I had several folks in the house down at one point.
Human 2:	 The flu is the worst! It's hard to deal with since you can't get well and have headaches and fevers and feel so run down
Human 1:	 Yes, everyone recovered now
