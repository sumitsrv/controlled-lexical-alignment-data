Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Hi I'm fine. How are you today?
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that. I think you should take all the cold medicine you can! I hope you recover quick!
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'm getting better, the worst part for me has been this cold. It wasn't even the sickness, it was just the sinus inf
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 I'm doing okay, just been a little sick today, the weather has been so cold here this week!
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I have a big trip planned for the end of this month and there's some place I really want to go, it would put me out of budget
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I'll be going back to the beaches for another Hawaii vacation in December
