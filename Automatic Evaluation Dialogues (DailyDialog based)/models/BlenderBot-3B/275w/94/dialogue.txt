Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 Have you had lunch yet?
Human 2:	 I have and I am hungry as hell!
Human 1:	 Cool. Where and what did you eat?
Human 2:	 I had lunch and did eat it at school.I am glad i did
Human 1:	 A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.
Human 2:	 I'm going to eat at some lunch and chicken is what I ordered
Human 1:	 Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.
Human 2:	 I'm glad you did eat lunch and I bet the shrimp was yummy!
Human 1:	 I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?
Human 2:	 I love all kinds of sandwiches, for lunch and dinner, so I had them all!
Human 1:	 I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?
Human 2:	 I love the food too! it's all I eat when I'm not too busy. What kind are you eating next?
