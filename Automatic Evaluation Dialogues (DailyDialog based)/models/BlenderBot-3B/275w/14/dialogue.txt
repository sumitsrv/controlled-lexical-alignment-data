Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	 Just doing some research for a class I'm taking. My professor likes how chill I am so I can't wait to see his reaction
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	 Just got back from a fun little night out, you know how that goes. The weather is nice so I am hanging out outside and taking a break
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 that's cool, what kind of coaster was it? and I am chillin as well, enjoying the weather
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 A roller coaster was the first thing that came to mind when you said you went to amusement park! It's my favorite thing to
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 Yea I've heard of that coaster but not the tallest roller coaster.  Do you have any other cool adrenaline rid
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 I'm not. I'm the opposite, adrenaline is bad for you and coaster rides scare me because they can really hurt
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 the roller coaster was a much better adrenaline rush because it actually scared me but i guess that's what made me love it so
