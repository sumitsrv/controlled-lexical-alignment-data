B|5| Human 2: [just] got back from a fun little night out , [you] _know_ [how] _that_ goes . _the_ weather is nice _so_ _i am_ hanging out outside _and_ taking a break 
A|6| Human 1: oh _that's cool_ ! [i] _actually_ _went to_ an _amusement park_ [and] _went_ on [my] _first_ _roller coaster_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [that's cool] , _what_ kind _of_ [coaster] _was_ _it ?_ [and] _i am_ chillin as well , enjoying _the_ weather 
A|8| Human 1: [it] [was] scary ! [it] [was] _actually_ kingda ka , [the] world's _tallest roller coaster ._ ever _heard of_ [it ?] 
B|9| Human 2: a [roller coaster] [was] [the] [first] thing _that_ came [to] mind when [you] said [you] [went to] [amusement park] ! _it's_ [my] favorite thing [to]

A|12| Human 1: same ! _i guess_ _the roller coaster_ wasn't [so] _bad_ _because_ [i] trust [the] engineering haha 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm not] . [i'm] [the] opposite , [adrenaline] is [bad] for [you] [and] [coaster] rides scare me [because] they can really hurt
