Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, nice seeing you
Human 1:	 Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?
Human 2:	 Yes! Christmas would be the best for kids. Do you know anyone who is going to be with them?
Human 1:	 Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.
Human 2:	 Yes, the kids and me are going. I have been a few times already and know you want to do the Christmas event so we plan for it
Human 1:	 Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.
Human 2:	 I would love to! I will drive the same route and stay around Disneyland for sure. 
Human 1:	 Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?
Human 2:	 The kids and I have not decided if that will be the plan. We might stay in for the holiday but I think we would rather drive down
Human 1:	 but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve
Human 2:	 That would work for sure and I can look up a little closer to christmas for hotels in Disneyland that have that same area.
Human 1:	 Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?
Human 2:	 that is great I can take you in for free if time and money are an issue
Human 1:	 Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.
Human 2:	 I can't wait to take my son to the amusement park! Maybe that will be my way of getting him away from me for a bit
