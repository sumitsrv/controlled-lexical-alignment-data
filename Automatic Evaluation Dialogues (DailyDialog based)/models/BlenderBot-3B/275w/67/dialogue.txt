Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I did my first skydiving lesson a couple of weeks ago.  I'm not gonna do it again for a long time though haha.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 I'm great!  Seville is a great town. My cousin moved there for work recently.
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 Yes I'm planning to do it again, it's an awesome feeling to jump out of a plane in the stratosphere.
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I tried free-falling, you know the term skydiving when you're falling before you jump out of a plane without a parachute
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I have done skydiving before for sure! I had a lot of fun, but that was when I was little, I should try again.
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 Yes I was very scared the first time, and still am when I try to skydive today, but I make myself do it any way.
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
