Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Hi! Its alright, been a long day. I work overnights and had to work through the day
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 It was a rough day, it was busy and I had to help my parents move their stuff in their new house. They are so messy!
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What was the project and what are your plans for it now?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I bet that was rough but you did a great thing for them.
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 that sounds stressful and I'm sorry you lost some work, maybe it was for the best
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 It's going pretty well. I'm trying out keto for the first time and that really helped with getting through it today
