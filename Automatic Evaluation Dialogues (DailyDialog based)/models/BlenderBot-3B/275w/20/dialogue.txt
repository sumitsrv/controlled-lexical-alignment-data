Human 1:	 Hello, Nice to meet you
Human 2:	 If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?
Human 1:	 Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?
Human 2:	 Stirfry, hands down. That's my go to.  What about you?
Human 1:	 I love ice cream too!
Human 2:	 Nice to meet you too! I would have to say Chinese Food too, that's my lifeblood! What about you?
Human 1:	 I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?
Human 2:	 Chocolate for the win! It's too bad I had Chinese and Stirfry the one time because I love them both. Cookies
Human 1:	 Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?
Human 2:	 I like the chocolate ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery and love sorbet too
Human 1:	 I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.
Human 2:	 Yeah, the more chocolatey the better, I love cookies and creams like you would get there too. I think sorbet falls under
Human 1:	 What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?
Human 2:	 Yes - something like that would have had to happen, but I still feel there's more than the physical world, but maybe that's how we experience
Human 1:	 Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.
