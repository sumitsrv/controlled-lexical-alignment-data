A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ do _you think about_ _human_ _like chat bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ [like chat bots] _that_ [you] _can_ program _and_ use for any purpose . 
A|4| Human 1: yep , we seemed _to have_ made _some_ _great_ progress over last few years . do _you _think_ _the_ positives_ _outweigh _the_ negatives_ 
B|5| Human 2: [the negatives] [outweigh [the] positives] for [the] most part but _it_ would _be_ interesting 
A|6| Human 1: [like] impersorsination ? though [it] _sounds_ _far_ fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: _i think_ imperssination [sounds] [like] _a_ [great] idea [to have] [human] [bots] . [it] would _be_ _so_ interesting [to] make one _that_ would read [you] [the] 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! _some_ of these [bots] _are_ very engaging [and] _funny_ . _they are_ now _good_ at even sarcasm [i] wonder how _far_ _are_ we _from_ [the] time these [bots] start giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [it] would _be_ interesting [to] program [and] use [chat bots] . [what] [are] [some] [good] ones [that] [you] [have] used in [the] past ? 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] research implication _is_ _also_ huge ! [it] will signify how ai research has progressed [so] _far_ [and] _better_ place [to] tackle _more_ futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping on [the] moon 🙂 [i] might [be] overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i [think] [the] negatives] [are] [more] [like] impediments [and] limitation [that] may [be] [far] [from] [good] . [like] [can] [you] imagine [a] bot [that] only 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions already do pretty [good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [they are] [good] [and] [also] [the current] [bots] [have] [more] capabilities [like] auto-completion , search engine optimization 
A|14| Human 1: haha , pretty [far] fetched 🙂 nice having _this_ conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: hahaha [that] was [funny] , [the] [more] [you think about] [it] [the] [better] [it] gets but there [is] always room for improvement [and] [this] [can] [be] for [good] or
