Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 Yes, you met me in the bathroom at the bank. It was very awkward.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 No! It was just at the bank I think! Did you have a long meeting together where we exchanged names and stuff?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 I don't think so. I have no idea where you are getting schwasty from.
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I'm sorry, have you ever worked on Alzheimer's patients before?
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what that is. It's when there are many different symptoms. I'm glad to know you have private practice, that must be
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 I'm talking about a real job that's not a private practice but it's also a real disease.
