Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How's your day been?

Human 2:	 I like fishing. I'd love to go to the ocean some day. New York would be great because there's so much you can do
Human 1:	 Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.
Human 2:	 I have never been there but the city is pretty nice. What's cool about Tokyo is that you can get to the ocean by train
