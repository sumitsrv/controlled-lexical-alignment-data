Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 What is your favorite holiday?
Human 1:	 one where I get to meet lots of different people.
Human 2:	 My birthday is right after christmas so i get to meet lots of people
Human 1:	 Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.
Human 2:	 That one where you get to keep count.
Human 1:	 I think it was Australia
Human 2:	 Australia is beautiful, I was there once, where did you go when you went there?
Human 1:	 Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them
Human 2:	 The people and everything are so different from what I am used to, but it was really fascinating
Human 1:	 what do you mean?
Human 2:	 Did you mean to link something
Human 1:	 Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky
Human 2:	 That's what I mean. How it's interesting and spooky at the same time to see things where you don't grow up but people there
Human 1:	 So, do you do treasure hunting often?
Human 2:	 Sometimes when it's hunting for treasure you are often spooked because you don't know what you can find and where it might be.
