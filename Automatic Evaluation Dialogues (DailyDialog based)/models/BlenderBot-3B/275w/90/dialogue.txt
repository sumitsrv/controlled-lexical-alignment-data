Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I would like to! How do you sign up for these events?
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 That sounds fun and like good for the community.  Have you participated before?
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 I have never participated the sports events before, but it does sound fun and like it will be for sure.
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I think the volunteers have to pay for their own ticket like other events and are given a couple days to sign up and get in line with
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 We will have the event at a park with a court and a couple of other sports fields.  That may work out well for me to vol
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 Its best to reserve early because they will get full. The volunteers may have to pay for everything out of the pot.
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 Oh. That's nice of you.  How long have you volunteered for the event?
Human 1:	 Thanks.
