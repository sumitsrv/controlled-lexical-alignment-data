Human 2:	 Yes!  I know that french is used in Canada, Quebec and most of North America.
Human 1:	 Did you go anywhere else in montreal?
Human 2:	 I used to take it but I forgot most of it too! I went to Montreal once and that was enough for me. Did you go anywhere
Human 1:	 Oh cool! I've always wanted to attend the Olympics As a viewer of course I watch a lot of Olympic figure skating on Youtube
Human 2:	 I've never been anywhere else in the U.S. but I want to go to ski in Europe and watch their skiing slop
Human 1:	 Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
Human 2:	 I wanted to ski but the only place that had slopes was at one resort so I just went on a lot of canal bo
Human 1:	 Are you good at <REDACTED_TERM>?
Human 2:	 I wanted to go in the summer but it was just too expensive for the tickets.  Are you any good at skiing?
