Human 2:	 I will be going with an older man that knows all the best restaurants in town
Human 1:	 Are you a food person, a sightseeing person or neither?
Human 2:	 Are you going for the food that's been around forever?
Human 1:	 I'm a food person I think. Any specific foods you're planning on trying?
Human 2:	 I am thinking about trying out that new food joint in Las Vegas, you know the one with the drag show every night at closing
Human 1:	 yeah my favorite is taco fish
Human 2:	 I have never been to Vegas, but I have always been curious about the food! I think taco fish sounds very tasty.
