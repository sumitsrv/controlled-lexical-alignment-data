Human 2:	 How was your day?
Human 1:	 haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?
Human 2:	 It was great, I ate like 6 Turkey dinners! How was your Thanksgiving?

Human 2:	 haha it was great! Turkey was the main meal for the whole night!
Human 1:	 did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?
Human 2:	 I cooked it from home, but it did not taste like traditional Turkey.  I was disappointed, lol. 
Human 1:	 Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉
Human 2:	 Turkey is the favorite of our family so it was hard not to make turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. But I always cook it from home
Human 1:	 we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?
Human 2:	 I was really excited because my family always has turkey on Thanksgiving as well but my dad had the day off and so I cooked and
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 I got together with my two big sisters and our kids and played the same games we did any day, but was fun to have everyone around and
