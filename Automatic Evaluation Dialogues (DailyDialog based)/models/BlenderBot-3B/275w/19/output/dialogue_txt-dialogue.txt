A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] [the] _superman !_ _what_ _about you_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hey there [superman !] whats [the] plan ? 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . _you_ won't see me . 
B|5| Human 2: [you] seem happy , why are [you] [invisible] ? 
A|6| Human 1: [i] _would_ rather trust _fmri and machine learning_ [to] do this _. i_ [am] _not_ _an_ expert on _that ._ sorry for _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [fmri and machine learning] _is_ [not] [that] simple , [the] data [would] only show [you] [what] _is_ happening _in_ super close proximity [to] [you] 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain imaging thing_ _that _can tell_ you_ _a_ brain's _activity_ _at_ _a_ _pretty_ high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: [the brain imaging thing] was [pretty] wild [. i] was [not] expecting [that .] 
A|10| Human 1: [i] _believe_ [in] _science_ ! _science is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science is] [pretty] cool . it's amazing [that] [science] [can tell you] everything [about] [the brain] from neural [activity] [and] how [it] connects people . [it] 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ _bad at science_ . [what] [can] [science] do ? [is] [it] [the] most _important_ [thing] for society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure [what] [you] mean [about] [the] [bad at science] [thing] , but it's [an] [important] field [that can tell] us [a] lot [about] [brain] [activity] 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] _make_ sense ? 
B|15| Human 2: [science] [and] [the] scientific method are [what] [make] us so much more than we are . [i'm] glad [you] [believe] [that .] how [about you] , [what]
