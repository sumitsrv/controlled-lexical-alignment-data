Human 1:	 Hi.
Human 2:	 Helloooooo!
Human 1:	 How are you? How is your day?
Human 2:	 Good. Yours?
Human 1:	 I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.
Human 2:	 I'm good! How was your day today? What about you?
Human 1:	 Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?
Human 2:	 I'm good, today's been very busy. Blue reminds me of the day I got my drivers license about ten years ago.
