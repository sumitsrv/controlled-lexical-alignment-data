Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Nothing much. I do need you to stop being so nice though. It scares me.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 I was the first time last week but I had to drive my friend somewhere because he did not have a ride to get home.
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 Oh, I had something similar last week! I was going to do something fun with my friend but it would have been awkward.
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 It was the longest time in my life.  It changed my view of life in a lot of ways.  I am not really sure it
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 Yes, but for the better I think. It seems like life is more fun and adventurous
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 Well life really is what you make it so I wish you the best of luck on your adventures and have fun!
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 Thank you - it really does sound like a lot of fun
