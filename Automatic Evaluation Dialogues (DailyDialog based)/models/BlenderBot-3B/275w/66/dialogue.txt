Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I ran a marathon a few weeks ago, I was hoping to PR but I ended up having a bad race. I have a bad knee
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 I am planning on marathoning the Boston Marathon in a couple months. How about you? 
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 It's not overtly challenging? I see the marathon is a 26 mile race which is like, a beast in and of itself
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 It's challenging but not overtly so like the marathon. My goal is to run and complete all the obstacles in
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 Its one of my all time favorite. It's the marathon race for over two weeks and in 2016 was held in Los Angeles and
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 I think the one next month will be good for you. I can't sign up until I get over this cold but I'm training for it and
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 That's a lot for me, but good luck with training. I like the idea of doing more physical challenges like obstacles. It
