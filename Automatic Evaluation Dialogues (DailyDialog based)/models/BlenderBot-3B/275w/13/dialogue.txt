Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 Last weekend I saw "The Parasite." Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 Yes that was a good movie! The plot twist was pretty neat! It was directed by Michael Mann.
Human 1:	 My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?
Human 2:	 I did see The Parasite with Roger Ebert and Christopher Doyle a few weekends ago. It was great,
Human 1:	 Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!
Human 2:	 I have seen the Mandalorian and you? The last movie I saw that I saw with an all female cast was Serenity
Human 1:	 lol Are you a big Marvel fan?
Human 2:	 i saw it last weekend with the big Marvel fan, RDJ and a friend of mine. it is great you have a good time.
Human 1:	 I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha
Human 2:	 I've seen the movies and can't wait for the second one to release in December!
Human 1:	 Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha
Human 2:	 I was not that big of a fan, the movies don't really seem that good, and Marvel does not know how to do villains too
Human 1:	 Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before
Human 2:	 I've heard that before hahah and the movies don't really do Loki and Thor any justice!
