Human 1:	 i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience
Human 2:	 ziplining is awesome! I'm looking forward to this weekend as much as I can. Do you have any interesting experience?
Human 1:	 i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though
Human 2:	 Yes it was a bit cold though.
Human 1:	 that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you
Human 2:	 I don't have any experience and I'm tired, i just did it with my family
Human 1:	 no, i'm going to get a massage first
Human 2:	 i'm going to get a massage too, and it will be my first time ziplining. I have never had one before.
Human 1:	 traditional kind
Human 2:	 I've always thought about it, but i'm a little concerned the lack of massage chairs and the lack of an audience
Human 1:	 you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!
Human 2:	 i think you should try it, massage therapy is an important tool to relax people and it really does a lot for them
