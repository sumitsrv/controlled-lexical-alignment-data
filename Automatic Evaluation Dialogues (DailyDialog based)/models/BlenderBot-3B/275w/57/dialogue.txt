Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 My day was going well, until my brother decided it would be a great idea to make us late for school to go get pizza.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I love pizzas and I would love twiddling your thumbs while eating it too. You lucky bastard
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I am lucky indeed, my day is going pretty smooth and I've been able to meet all my work deadlines. Hows your day?
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 How is work going for you right now?
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would love to be going to work and twiddling all the places
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 I would love that too and you don't have to fly with the dive buddy just because of your body weight. 
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 Its very expensive but the world is just so much nicer when you can do what you want
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 Well that's too bad you can't explore because it's so expensive
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
