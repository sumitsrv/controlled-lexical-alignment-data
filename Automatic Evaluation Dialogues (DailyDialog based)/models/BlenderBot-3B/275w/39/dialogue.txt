Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 Any big plans for the upcoming holidays?
Human 2:	 I am going to the beach for a few days. I have been waiting for it all year
Human 1:	 That sounds amazing. I want to learn how to ski but I feel like I'm too old and falls would have lifelong impacts. Are you going with friends?
