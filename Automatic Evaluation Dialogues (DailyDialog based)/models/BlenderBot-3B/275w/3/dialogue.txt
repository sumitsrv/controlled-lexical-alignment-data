Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 Not so bad, it's raining a little bit and I have my raincoat on
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 They make rainy days gloomy for sure. It will make the leaves change colors too!
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 Yeah it's raining pretty bad here too. I hate the sound of water running!
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 I don't like it that much either the water rains so much here too, it can make the leaves run
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 that's too bad, have you ever tried taking a trip there?  the weathers can change drastically!
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 No but I would rather go there and see it from the air than water lol
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
