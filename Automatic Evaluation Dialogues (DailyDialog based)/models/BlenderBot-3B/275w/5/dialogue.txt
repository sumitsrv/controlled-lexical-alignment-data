Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I am sad too. How long did it last?
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 I miss her too. I've tried banging the catfood dish and shouting for her name but no such luck, I'm just going
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I would have loved to go back home and just relaxing at my parents place.
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 I would love to go to canada and go to the rainforests there.
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I'm scared about ziplines too, but I heard there are safety measures you can take that reduce the risk significantly.
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 that would be a fun and exciting idea
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 I won't lie, zipline are pretty scary and there is a reason why it's been banned in most national parks.
