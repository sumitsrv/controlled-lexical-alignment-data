Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's it going?
Human 1:	 It's good! How is your day?
Human 2:	 It's good! I have to go work out soon, my muscles are really sore, I've been training hard
Human 1:	 Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?
Human 2:	 It was great! I went rock climbing on weekend and the views are so beautiful! How about your day? I can see sore muscles
Human 1:	 Oh nice! What movie?
Human 2:	 It was nice for you! This weekend I went on a day hike and it was very scenic and relaxing and good exercise
Human 1:	 Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!
Human 2:	 My weekend was great too. Had the day off and I saw the movie The Force Awakens. I was very impressed by that film. What
Human 1:	 Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!
Human 2:	 that's great it's good to get out and break the norm when you can, i'm always a little afraid of heights though
Human 1:	 Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?
Human 2:	 I can imagine, it was nice not being here, but that's the winter weather for you. How are things going?
Human 1:	 Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!
Human 2:	 I prefer the winter too actually but the summer is not bad! you are more than right about that when it comes to Australia it's pretty scary at
