Human 2:	 haha yes the UFC is fun to watch live. this weekend I will be going to the bar with friends and have a little fighty time
Human 1:	 It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.
Human 2:	 I'm actually really out of the loop but that sounds like fun. Are you going to be competing or just watching?
Human 1:	 Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!
Human 2:	 I am not the hokey pokey kind but it's still pretty cool that you have found it and are competing. Good luck!
