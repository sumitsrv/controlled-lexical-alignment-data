Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 Hello, you must not be the sharpest crayon in the box if you can't understand lectures.
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	 I understand the concepts I just have no time right now.
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 Sure, the lecture was going slow for you last week or this week?
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 I have plenty of time before the test but not now. I think I am going to do some studying though and try to cram for today
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 It going good. This course will be very easy for me but the test may be difficult,
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 I hope you are right, I have pretty much lost all motivation to do well because of the week.
