B|5| Human 2: [you can] [believe in miracles] but [know] there's [no] way for [them] _to_ happen 
A|6| Human 1: [right] now , _not much_ _. it's_ unclear . career _is_ _a_ _good_ _fallback_ _because_ [you] get told what _good_ means _and_ [you] act accordingly . [i] haven't gone through _the_ process _of_ shaping my values . what about [you] ?

B|11| Human 2: [not much] [of] [a] [fallback] when [you] [have] [to] [grow up] poor [and] there's [not much] [to] do [in] [the] city . but [people] [can] [change] [things] 
A|12| Human 1: all their money ? by [a] person or an organisation ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i] [grew up] [in] [the] us [. [not] much] emphasis on personal finance until after college . [it] [didn't] seem [to] dawn on [people] until
