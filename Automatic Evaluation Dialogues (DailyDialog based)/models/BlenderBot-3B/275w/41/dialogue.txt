Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 i know right? people can be so sucky. 
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 you can believe in miracles but know there's no way for them to happen
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 Yeah and I feel there is always the fallback of just not doing well. It's much safer.
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 It's good not to have too many miracles because there is so much you can't predict and the world is not fair.
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 Not much of a fallback when you have to grow up poor and there's not much to do in the city.  But people can change things
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 I grew up in the US. Not much emphasis on personal finance until after college. It didn't seem to dawn on people until
