Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 I've been pondering too and I think its someone I need to help me
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I understand. You have been through a lot with the friendship. But I would not feel good doing that to someone's partner because they are trying
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's a good choice though, their friendship means the world to you so you have to keep all the bonds, right?
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 That's really good advice. I've been the invited friend like a lot of the time though, so I might have to be selfish and not
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 That's the goal! It means that it's all for the better, because if they like you but you don't like them, then they are
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 It's the only way to go about it I think. People are always busy, that's life but don't let them take away from your personal
