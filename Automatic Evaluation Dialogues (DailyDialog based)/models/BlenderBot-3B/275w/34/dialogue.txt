Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?
Human 1:	 Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?
Human 2:	 No plans tonight yet. Are you gonna have any fun plans?
Human 1:	 Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂
Human 2:	 not thanksgiving, but christmas plans for sure, i have ppl coming over.  you got any big plans
Human 1:	 True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P
Human 2:	 you may end up sharing with the whole family!  It depends on if your parents are more for it or not, I think they would love to
Human 1:	 Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)
Human 2:	 I think what would be cool for the family is to make a whole pie with a lot of different stuffing recipes and then just have everyone
Human 1:	 Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.
Human 2:	 you do that for the whole family and then what?
Human 1:	 I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂
Human 2:	 Yeah that sounds like fun.
Human 1:	 Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.
