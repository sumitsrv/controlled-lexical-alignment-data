Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 I'm eating croissants right now! It's my favorite pastry from the Italian bakery next to the café
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I have made croissants once or twice in my life. It's not a recipe you make everyday but they were so flakey
Human 1:	 Ah, good thought, thanks!
Human 2:	 I've made them once or twice. I thought they were good, but they have been so long ago. What kind of flour did you use
Human 1:	 Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?
Human 2:	 I am trying to make them right now actually. I haven't done it before, but I'm hoping they'll be good once I have a few
Human 1:	 Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.
Human 2:	 I actually don't eat too much sweets, they've been hard to find at the groceries that carry them for some time. 
Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I think they have been in the family for so long that they are too hard to get away with anymore. But I was surprised that you could make
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
