A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello . how's your week coming along ? 
A|2| Human 1: _it's_ great , thanks . _i'm_ _trying to_ learn how _to make_ _croissants_ . 
B|3| Human 2: [i'm] eating [croissants] right _now_ ! [it's] my favorite pastry from _the_ italian bakery _next_ [to] _the_ café 
A|4| Human 1: _i've_ _done_ _them once or twice_ _so_ far _, but they_ _haven't_ _been_ _flakey_ enough . [i'm] _trying to_ figure out why _. what kind of_ cookies _have_ _you_ _made_ ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ [have] [made] [croissants] [once or twice] in my life . [it's] _not_ _a_ recipe [you] [make] everyday [but they] were [so] [flakey] 
A|6| Human 1: ah , _good_ _thought_ , thanks ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [made] [them once or twice] . _i_ [thought] [they] were [good] [, but they] [have] [been] [so] long ago [. what kind of] flour did [you] use 
A|8| Human 1: [now] _that_ is [a] [good] idea . i'll give _it_ [a] try [next] _time ._ would [you] say [you] _have a_ sweet tooth ? 
B|9| Human 2: _i_ am [trying [to] make] [them] right [now] actually . _i_ [haven't] [done] [it] before [, but] [i'm] hoping they'll be [good] [once] _i_ [have a] few 
A|10| Human 1: _some_ people _don't_ ! [but] yeah , me _too_ , _i think_ i'd _eat_ pastries all [the] _time_ if [i] _could_ _get away with_ [it] . 
B|11| Human 2: [i] actually [don't] [eat] [too] much _sweets_ , they've [been] hard [to] find at [the] groceries [that] carry [them] for [some] [time .] 
A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] [that] sort [of] stuff _was_ when <redacted_term> _was_ being marketed as [a] fat substitute , and caused all sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] [they] [have] [been] in [the] family for [so] long [that] [they] are [too] hard [to] [get away with] anymore . [but] [i] [was] surprised [that] [you] [could] [make] 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe that's [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy [sweets] and [not] feel guilty 🙂
