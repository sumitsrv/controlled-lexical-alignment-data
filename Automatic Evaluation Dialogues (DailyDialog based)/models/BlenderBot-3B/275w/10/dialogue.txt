Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Not bad, trying to decide how to make lunch now.
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	 Oh well that's fine it happens. I didn't do so well myself, how are you going to study for your test
Human 1:	 Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')
Human 2:	 I don't think he was actually the first European who set foot on North American's so, it was already there when he got there.
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 I think I did pretty well, the class is History of Civil War. What's it about you?
Human 1:	 Oh I see. What do you do?
Human 2:	 I am in the History class next semester. I see you are taking a history class as well. What is your major?
Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 I am into history. What a coincidence. How you do not know the origins of the horse is beyond me
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	 That's cool. I am currently taking an elective. It's for a class in the history of the United States.
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	 No I do not win any money for participation. I am very busy. I know you were kidding.  That's sounds cool
