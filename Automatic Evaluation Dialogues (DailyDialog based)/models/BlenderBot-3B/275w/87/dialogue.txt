Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great today! I was thinking of what to make for lunch! You?
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading the suttas of Laozi. What are you looking over the ocean?
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 I have the book that I'm reading now, and I'm enjoying it so far. It's about how the ocean has over 2 billion years
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I'm reading the book that I read for school last week, Zero to One: how to sleep better in the deep end!
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I like Peter Thiel's book but it is about how technology and the internet has changed society for the better.  It is a good read
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 that's cool! I'm sure you want to have the book for future reference and to help yourself study in the future. Are it about how start
Human 1:	 yup!
