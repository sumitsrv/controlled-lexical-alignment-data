Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 Do you have a favourite flower?
Human 2:	 I like to gently touch flower.
Human 1:	 I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?
Human 2:	 I love flowers, the lotus flower. Its the smallest and most beautiful plant
Human 1:	 Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure actually, it's one of the more common flower that's grown worldwide so maybe you just think of it a lot
Human 1:	 The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.
Human 2:	 I like the flower's smell and it reminds me of my youth
Human 1:	 Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?
Human 2:	 that's just it though with flower you never know what the person wants their flowers to be like. 
Human 1:	 Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila
Human 2:	 I think you're right with the flower's sense, they make some people feel relaxed and it's that good smell.
Human 1:	 Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!
