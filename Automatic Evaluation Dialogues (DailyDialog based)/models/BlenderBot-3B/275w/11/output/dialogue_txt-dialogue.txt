A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello 
A|2| Human 1: do _you_ have _a_ favourite _flower_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: _i_ _like_ _to_ gently touch _flower ._ 
A|4| Human 1: _i'm_ working on _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ love flowers , [the lotus] _flower ._ its [the] smallest _and_ most beautiful plant 
A|6| Human 1: oh _, it's_ _not_ research ! _just_ _a_ personal theory . _i think_ _that_ [flower] preferences are _more_ revealing _of_ personality than _people_ appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure actually [, it's] one [of] [the] [more] common [flower] _that's_ grown worldwide _so_ _maybe_ [you] [just] [think] [of] _it_ [a] lot 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . [it's] [like] [a] cartoon [flower .] as if [you] drew "flower" _with_ [a] crayon [and] then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [like] [the] flower's smell [and] [it] reminds me [of] my youth 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 is , [you] ask someone _what_ _their_ favourite [flower] is . pretty much [like] _what_ we [just] did . does _that_ _make_ _sense_ [so] far ? 
B|11| Human 2: _that's_ [just] [it] though [with] [flower] [you] never know [what] _the person_ wants [their] flowers [to] be [like] . 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk _with [the_ person] _some_ [more] , [and] ask them _some_ [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] _sense_ [of] [what] they're [like] , over [the] course [of] [maybe] two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: [i think] you're right [with the] flower's [sense] , they [make] [some] [people] feel relaxed [and] [it's] [that] good smell . 
A|14| Human 1: why thank [you] , [that's] [a] wonderful idea !
