Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	 I am listening to the music I use for my job, I make youtube videos for a living. What about you are you going to listen to?
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	 Mine went so well that the music was a success for the company! They are going to use it on a show!
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 I play guitar as well, and a lot of different instruments. What kind are you learning first? 
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 That sounds great! I play the guitar, I can't for the life of me play drums though! The chords are difficult, well bar
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 That is true. It is like the guitar you know. I can't play it for the life of me though.
