Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 going well, just got done playing with my new nintendo
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 My moped broke down too and then the shop tried giving me less work than they fixed because i didn't own the car so they charged me
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 lol that sucks, the mechanic trying to take advantage of you.
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Yes, that sounds like the mechanic trying to take advantage of you for sure! lol The best way out of this is to have some good ol time
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 Sure, I don't work today so that should be fine
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 I appreciate your understanding but you should think the same way because of their record. I am worried they are going to take advantage of me because this is
