A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: _what_ was _the_ most difficult thing _you_ experienced _this_ past _year_ ? 
A|2| Human 1: _i_ normally don't reflect back _too_ _much_ on _things_ _, but_ _i_ guess 2019 _have been very_ favorable _for me_ _in_ terms _of_ time spent _with_ _family_ _and_ friends _and work_ _life balance_ . why _do you_ ask ? 
B|3| Human 2: [i] [have been] pretty _busy_ [with] [life] [and work] [too] [but] [things] [have been very] _good_ [for me] . 
A|4| Human 1: _great_ ! [good] _idea_ _to_ help _people_ figuring out their _new_ [year] resolutions 🙂 so _how_ _do_ [i] _get a fresher outlook_ ? 🙂 
B|5| Human 2: [you] can [get a fresher outlook] [with] [work] [and] [how] [much] [you] [have been] doing 
A|6| Human 1: wow ! sounds amazing if we practice _that_ ! _i think_ _the idea_ does [have] some potential . _how did you come up with this_ _idea_ ? 
B|7| Human 2: [good] [you] [have been] doing [very] well [with] [that] , [this] [year] has [been] _one_ _for the_ [people] , [and] [family] [too] . 
A|8| Human 1: thats _great_ ! [this] _is_ valuable help [for the] community . _i think_ mental health _is_ [one] _of_ [the] bigger challenges facing humanity . 
B|9| Human 2: [i] know [you] are _busy_ [with] [work] [, but] [think] [that] [the idea] [is] [great] [for] [you] [and] your [family] , [how did you come up with this] project . 
A|10| Human 1: [that] [is] _actually_ [a] quote stolen _from_ _my_ tl when [i] joined _my_ first _company_ after graduation . [i] guess now after 5 yrs _of_ [work] _experience_ , [i] fully agree [with] _it_ 🙂 
B|11| Human 2: [the idea] came [from] [the] [company] [that] [did] [the] [work] [for] [my] [company] [actually] . [that] way everyone [is] happy . 
A|12| Human 1: 1 . stay happy; _i think_ [family] [and] friends play [a] big role here . 2 . meaningful [work] life; [this] _may_ mean exploring around [with] _new_ stuff 3 . multiple _hobbies_ [that] keep [you] [busy] ... so on 🙂 [what] about [you] ? [is] there [a] right answer _to_ [this] ? :) 
B|13| Human 2: _that's_ [great] [you] [have] [experience] [with] [work] [and] [life balance] [i think] [this] [year] has [been] [a] real struggle [for me] 
A|14| Human 1: nice ! [that's] [very] thoughtful [and] spiritual 🙂 also _music_ earned [a] spot 🙂 yay ! 
B|15| Human 2: [that's] [great] [that] [you] got [this] [work] [from] [and] _it may_ lead [to] [new] opportunities . 
A|16| Human 1: [i] am [actually] not [much] _of_ [a] reader . [i] usually hide [it] by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂 
B|17| Human 2: no worries [and] [music] [is] [very] important [for me] as well . [what] kind [of] [hobbies] [do you] [think] [you] will [have] [in] [the] [new] job ? 
A|18| Human 1: hehe ! true ! [it may] turn out [to] be [a] best seller :)
