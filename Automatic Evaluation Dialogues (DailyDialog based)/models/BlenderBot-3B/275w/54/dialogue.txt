Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello there, how is it going?
Human 1:	 Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?
Human 2:	 It is great to hear that you won a game. What kind of game was it?
Human 1:	 No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.
Human 2:	 I was playing ping pong and for some reason I won. It felt amazing.
Human 1:	 Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?
Human 2:	 I guess that's a really fun game and you were just really confident in your game, great!
Human 1:	 What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet
Human 2:	 I'm just your average guy that's like really good at racquetball, but I guess for you to win something is great. Whats
Human 1:	 Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?
Human 2:	 I like it because it's very physical, fast-paced, and it involves hitting a ball with a stick that is made of wood.
Human 1:	 That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!
Human 2:	 it is really fun and physical, but I'm bad so I don't think I can win that.
Human 1:	 What a good idea, I'd love to!
