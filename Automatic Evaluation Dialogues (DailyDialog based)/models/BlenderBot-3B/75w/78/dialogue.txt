Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
Human 1:	 Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha
Human 2:	 It is my dream, but I want to learn to cook before I do anything.
Human 1:	 I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?
Human 2:	 I have always wanted to do pastries!  Cake was the only baked good that I'm okay at and not good enough to be considered
Human 1:	 haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...
Human 2:	 I'm funny and charming, but my mind is not the strongest when it comes to cooking haha!
Human 1:	 Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?
Human 2:	 I'm funny and charming too but not a chef haha. It was just that the icing all around the cake looked the right consistency
Human 1:	 No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?
Human 2:	 I enjoy baking pies for christmas and the holidays. I love making them with icing that is made from fruit preserves
Human 1:	 Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?
Human 2:	 Haha, well the cake was a small one to be honest, but I can always work with that. I'm a pastry chef for P
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.
Human 2:	 I work for a bakery, and I make cakes, the icing is the best part. What kind of pies you like to
