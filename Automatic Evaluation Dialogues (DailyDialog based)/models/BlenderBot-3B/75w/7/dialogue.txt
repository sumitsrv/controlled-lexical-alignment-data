Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
Human 1:	 I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?
Human 2:	 My favorite lately would  be Jurassic world but I'm a big fan of the first few movies
Human 1:	 it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature
Human 2:	 Avatar is awesome, it's the highest grossing movie of all time.
Human 1:	 yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?
Human 2:	 yea I like movies that have lots of science-fiction and fantasy elements. Avatar looks nice
Human 1:	 I enjoy eating 🙂
Human 2:	 Well, I like to cook and bake. I make lots of different kinds of pastries but never anything that can even come close to Jur
Human 1:	 I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?
Human 2:	 I like food from different cultures and have been studying different types of cuisine in China and India lately
Human 1:	 Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?
Human 2:	 No I do not! But I have a foodie friend who is coming to visit soon that will make me some homemade noodle sou
Human 1:	 Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook
Human 2:	 I like to cook too! I make a lot of soups, and I bake. I love to bake though! It is so much
