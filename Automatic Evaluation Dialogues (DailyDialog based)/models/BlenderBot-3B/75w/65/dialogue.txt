Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hi it is good how are you
Human 1:	 Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...
Human 2:	 Good morning, sorry the bike is getting fixed. 
Human 1:	 The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you had it and how did the mechanic figure it out so far?
Human 1:	 Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?
Human 2:	 Sure that sounds good and I'm sorry the moped is out of commission. Did he say what the problem was?
Human 1:	 That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?
Human 2:	 I was not able to drive today but you can pick it up the next day.  I know you are in a bad mood.
Human 1:	 Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!
Human 2:	 Yeah, but I think the problem was that I did something dumb.  I'll just have it towed home and take it to another shop.
