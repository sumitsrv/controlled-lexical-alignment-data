Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello. How's your week coming along?
Human 1:	 It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.
Human 2:	 I am great thanks for asking! I am just about to leave work and go to the store, I'm ready to get a croissant
Human 1:	 I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?
Human 2:	 I haven't made croissants yet but I have been making cookies. I'm trying out a new recipe and they are amazing!

Human 1:	 Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.
Human 2:	 I know what you mean and that's a tough one. What do you know about the health implications of processed food? 
Human 1:	 Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂
