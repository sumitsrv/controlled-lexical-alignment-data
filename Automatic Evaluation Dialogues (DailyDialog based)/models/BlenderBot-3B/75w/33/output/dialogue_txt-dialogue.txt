B|5| Human 2: _i_ [haven't] [made] [croissants] yet [but] _i_ [have] [been] making [cookies] [. i'm trying] [out] _a_ new recipe _and_ [they] are amazing ! 
A|6| Human 1: ah , good thought , [thanks] ! 
B|7| Human 2: [i've] [been] busy ! [i'm trying to] _get_ [out] [of] _the_ habit [of] eating junkfood [but] [it's] hard [to] resist , especially _if_ [they] [have]

A|12| Human 1: wow ! [the] last [time] [i] paid attention [to] that sort [of] stuff was when <redacted_term> was being marketed as [a] fat substitute , [and] caused [all] sorts [of] crazy stomach upsets . 
B|13| Human 2: [i] know [what] [you] mean [and] _that's_ [a] tough one [. what] do [you] know about [the] health implications [of] processed food ? 
A|14| Human 1: ah , maybe [that's] [the] solution [i] need [to] enjoy sweets [and] not feel guilty 🙂
