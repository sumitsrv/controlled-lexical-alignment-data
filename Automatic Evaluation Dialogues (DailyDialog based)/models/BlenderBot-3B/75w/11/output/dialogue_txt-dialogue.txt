A|4| Human 1: i'm working on _a_ theory . why does _the lotus_ spring [to] mind ? 
B|5| Human 2: _i_ don't _. i_ [have] always been _more_ _of_ [a] dog _person_ . how long [have] [you] had [the lotus] ? 
A|6| Human 1: oh , _it's_ _not_ research ! just [a] personal theory [. _i] think that_ _flower_ preferences _are_ [more] revealing [of] personality than people appreciate . 
B|7| Human 2: i've only had _it_ for about [a] month but [i think] she's my new favorite _flower ._ they [are] usually [not] [that] _pretty_ , they can 
A|8| Human 1: [the] gerbera . _it's_ _like_ [a] cartoon [flower .] as if [you] drew "flower" [with] [a] crayon _and_ then [it] came [to] life . 
B|9| Human 2: [the lotus] _flower is_ gorgeous ! [it's] very long [and] widespread 
A|10| Human 1: ok , step 1 [is] , [you] ask someone what their favourite [flower is] . [pretty] much _like_ what we just did . does [that] make sense _so_ far ? 
B|11| Human 2: [i think that] [is] [so] cute !! [i] [like] _them_ , too ... [it's] funny [you] say [that] ! they [are] called [lotus] [flower] , because they 
A|12| Human 1: cool . step 2: talk [with the] [person] some [more] , [and] ask [them] some [more] questions , [and] gradually develop [a] sense [of] what they're [like] , over [the] course [of] maybe two [to] five years . [and] voila 
B|13| Human 2: yea they [are] really neat flowers [and] [i] [like] [them] for [that] reason .
