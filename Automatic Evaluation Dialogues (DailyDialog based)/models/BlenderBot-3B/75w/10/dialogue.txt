Human 2:	 Hey
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hello, thank you for asking. I am a little tired, I just got back from a bike ride. How about you?
Human 1:	 Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..
Human 2:	 I am tired too. It is hard to concentrate when you are thinking of your history test

Human 2:	 He did, the vikings just didn't make him aware it.
Human 1:	 I know right! Are you taking History next semester?
Human 2:	 I know right? I had such a hard time with the test that I had 2 people taking it and the professor didn't even know where Col

Human 1:	 Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?
Human 2:	 I have been into horses for several years now. I love riding horse.
Human 1:	 Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?
Human 2:	 It's a job that I volunteer at, it was pretty cool, but I didn't do well since I wasn't prepared at all.
Human 1:	 Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?
Human 2:	 It's definitely a big responsibility, but I'm pretty proud to say that I do!  I train all the horses at my job,
