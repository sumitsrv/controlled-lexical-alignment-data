Human 1:	 Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?
Human 2:	 Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.
Human 1:	 lol it is really like a robot answer
Human 2:	 I know. I've tried to plan for it for so long
Human 1:	 ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?
Human 2:	 I have not heard about the poet yet.  But you can have dinner on Thursday if you like
Human 1:	 I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?
Human 2:	 I like human more, I don't see computers being able to tell me when the pizza is done
Human 1:	 What's your favorite computer language then 🙂
Human 2:	 I agree kale isn't the best. What's your favorite? I love computers. Especially when the internet is involved.
Human 1:	 Yes!
Human 2:	 I don't talk to either of them more than human, since they both seem to be able to sense my desire to not talk to either lol
Human 1:	 lol
