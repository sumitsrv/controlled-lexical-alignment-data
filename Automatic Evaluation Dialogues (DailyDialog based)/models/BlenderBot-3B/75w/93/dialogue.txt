Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hi, what's up!
Human 1:	 Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?
Human 2:	 I feel great! I'm out of work and just got an awesome new job. And you?
Human 1:	 Do you have interesting plans?
Human 2:	 I am doing good thank you for asking, I have been thinking about the holidays this week, do you have plans this weekend?
Human 1:	 Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.
Human 2:	 I do! I'm going to this place nearby that's got really nice views of the countryside. The food is good too!
Human 1:	 Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.
Human 2:	 Which conference did you see on Twitter?
Human 1:	 I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?
Human 2:	 I was going to the local fair.
Human 1:	 You attend these often?
Human 2:	 It was the Gay Rights conference in DC, it will be great to meet all these great people.
