Human 2:	 Nice. Well i know you cooked at home. How did it turn out? Did you have any leftovers?
Human 1:	 Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.
Human 2:	 Yes, I played games and drank wine the whole day. It was great with the family. I'm happy that you had a good Thanksg
