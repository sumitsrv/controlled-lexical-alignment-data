Human 2:	 hello
Human 1:	 how is the youtube video creation going?
Human 2:	 Hi. I'm going to start the video later today.

Human 2:	 Hi!  What do you mean what soft wares?
Human 1:	 oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?
Human 2:	 I think you might be the one to ask.  I like to use music that has a relaxation-type quality.  What kind of
Human 1:	 Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉
Human 2:	 You are going to love this one I think! The composer is a Canadian composer! 
Human 1:	 Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week
Human 2:	 Wow, that's cool. I love music, especially the guitar. But I've always been more a singer. My best friend played guitar too
Human 1:	 yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though
Human 2:	 Yeah they are tough to play but I love them though.
Human 1:	 That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word
Human 2:	 Yea I know what you are saying, the chords can get pretty confusing and there is no one true method to learning them, it all depends on
