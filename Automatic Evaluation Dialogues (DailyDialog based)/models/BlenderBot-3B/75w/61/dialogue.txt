Human 2:	 What's your name?
Human 1:	 My name is pikachu. it’s nice to meet you! What are you up to this month?
Human 2:	 Hi! My pikachu is a japanese pokemon I named it Ash lol!
Human 1:	 I’m trying to organize my life and start the new year ready to go! What about you?
Human 2:	 I am trying to organize and finish up my yearly project.
Human 1:	 What do you do to unwind?
Human 2:	 I really love watching movies and playing basketball. It is my most favorite pass time. Do you do it as well?
Human 1:	 Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.
Human 2:	 I love to play basketball as well, the Pokémon game and the real one are two very different things.
Human 1:	 In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that’s why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?
Human 2:	 I used to play Pokemon when I was younger, but now I've never played since they made it the name "gotcha game".
Human 1:	 What is your favorite show to watch right now?
Human 2:	 What type of device do you use to watch the show?
Human 1:	 I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.
Human 2:	 No, I actually haven't seen that! But you should really find time to play and get your old collection, the games are so fun and cute
Human 1:	 Do you like cats or dogs better? Do you have any pets?
Human 2:	 I'm watching cat videos right now. My cat just got out.
