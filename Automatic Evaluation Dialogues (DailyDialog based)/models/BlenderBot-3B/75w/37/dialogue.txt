Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great now my friends came for my party earlier, you should come too! It is really nice to have people to hang out with.
Human 1:	 Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?
Human 2:	 I would prefer with a group, but I do not have friends so that may just be me wanting that social interaction.
Human 1:	 I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?
Human 2:	 I think I would prefer with a group because then you can go for a long time. 
Human 1:	 I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.
Human 2:	 I would recommend it, but be careful not to get sucked into playing it like I did, that's not a good way to spend your night.
Human 1:	 I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.
Human 2:	 I would recommend it for sure. What's your favorite read?
Human 1:	 What's the most recent good thing you read?
Human 2:	 I like reading too! It's good you can use the game for so much more than just entertainment.
