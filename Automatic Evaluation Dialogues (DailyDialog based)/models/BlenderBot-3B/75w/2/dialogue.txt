Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey there! What's up???
Human 1:	 Nothing much, how you doin?
Human 2:	 Just taking a break. Been working all day.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?
Human 2:	 I last saw him about a week ago!
Human 1:	 Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...
Human 2:	 I'd rather it was that way I never saw her in the last 20 years, I can't even say how long ago we were best friends.
Human 1:	 Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?
Human 2:	 Oh wow, it was just yesterday!  That's so nice you are going to meet up with your friend!  What has changed about the friend
Human 1:	 Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!
Human 2:	 It's like the old times, but better this time, it will be fun. 
Human 1:	 Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?
Human 2:	 I wish that I had more time for adventures like you and I hope she has an adventure too, have you heard of the Avalan
Human 1:	 Sure! What does your Saturday look like?
Human 2:	 Yes! We do that every weekend I am so ready for it, she was in a car accident last month so we decided to try it out since
