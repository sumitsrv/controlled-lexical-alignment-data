Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi! How are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great how are you??
Human 2:	 I'm great. Finally my daughter got a new car that is much nicer than the one I used to have.
Human 1:	 are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?
Human 2:	 I'm doing great today! I just finished my coffee, and you?
Human 1:	 I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha
Human 2:	 I'm great too.   I like coffee as well but tea is better because I love hot chocolate.
Human 1:	 that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?
Human 2:	 It's colder in these hot streets during the night, that's probably why I like drinking it haha
Human 1:	 I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?
Human 2:	 Oh yeah, I know. I'm thinking of some cocao and baking it up for cold nights. Do you like tea?
Human 1:	 hahaha that's a great way to put it
Human 2:	 It's definitely worth it, just make sure you do it at someone's house and it doesn't have hot water, as that can be dangerous
Human 1:	 Yeah. I'll try to get a group together. ttyl!
Human 2:	 Yeah, I try to get a cup after a long day tubing and relax. I don't drink tea though, but I think I would
