Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
Human 2:	 I'm doing awesome and sad that I have to work all day today.
Human 1:	 Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?
Human 2:	 What a great idea! I'm just sitting here playing with her cat, her name is mittens and she's so cute.
Human 1:	 If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
Human 2:	 I don't do too much traveling, but I love going to a resort in the mountains in my state. I would love to take
Human 1:	 I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
Human 2:	 That sounds nice. Have you ever visited any mountains in Florida?
Human 1:	 I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
Human 2:	 I would love to travel to Mongolia! It sounds amazing! How about you?
Human 1:	 If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Human 2:	 I want to zipline from tree to tree and be scared of heights at the same time
Human 1:	 Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!
Human 2:	 I have and you should totally go! I would love to zipline from a tree! It feels so free as opposed to a traditional one.
