Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey! How’s your day going?
Human 1:	 Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
Human 2:	 Pretty good. What about you?
Human 1:	 I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
Human 2:	 I had a good day. How was yours?
Human 1:	 A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Human 2:	 I'm so sorry to hear that. Did your project get shelved for some unknown reason?
Human 1:	 Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
Human 2:	 I lost someone that i'm good friends with, I cried a lot and was devastated for some days. It was horrible, but you
Human 1:	 No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?
Human 2:	 I was a bit of a wreck that day. I had just lost my mother. That's why it was so bad and unexpected
Human 1:	 Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.
Human 2:	 It was going pretty poorly, but I'm trying to keep my head up. Life is so difficult now for my family.
