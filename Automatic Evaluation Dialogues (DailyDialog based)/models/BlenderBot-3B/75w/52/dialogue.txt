Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, how are you doing today?
Human 1:	 I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.
Human 2:	 Well, they are giving out goodies, some kind of chocolate, they are really sweet
Human 1:	 I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂
Human 2:	 I heard that aswell, they are giving out some sweets, a new jacket, and a sweater.
Human 1:	 Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!
Human 2:	 I agree! Its cold enough that they are cancelling work for the next two days! Hopefully I don't get sick!
Human 1:	 Oh nice! Where did you live before?
Human 2:	 That is nice,  I am sure you are happy for the goodies.  I don't like cold too much
Human 1:	 New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!
Human 2:	 Yes the cold weather is so nice! I live in Newyork as well. But its been a cooler night
Human 1:	 Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.
Human 2:	 Yes, the weather has been nice for sure and the roads are nice and clear.
Human 1:	 The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.
Human 2:	 The one in Newyork? Are you talking about the one in Los Angeles?
