Human 2:	 Hi!
Human 1:	 nice meeting you. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I'm going to play with my pet monkey!
Human 1:	 yea, same here. any food you're craving for?
Human 2:	 Nice, I was thinking about what I would eat for dinner tonight. I think pizza, but it will be too late to make it
Human 1:	 arghhh hard question ... I only know Ramen places for Japanese food 🙂
Human 2:	 Hi! I have had sushi tonight! Ramen is also good but sometimes you just want to try something else.
Human 1:	 San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂
Human 2:	 i love ramen, and the best ones you can get now are the instant noodles. i used to love the kind in my grandma
Human 1:	 my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?
Human 2:	 That's a great choice. San Mateo has a very good Japanese Ramen scene. 
Human 1:	 excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs
Human 2:	 Yeah, Dojo is excellent. My husband and I went there when we lived at the beach.
Human 1:	 yup it's delicious!
