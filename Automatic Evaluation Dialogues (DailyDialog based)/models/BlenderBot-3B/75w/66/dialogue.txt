Human 1:	 Hi
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 any improvements in your marathon time?
Human 2:	 I think so! I didn't expect that my race time was going to be so good!
Human 1:	 I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?
Human 2:	 Not right now, but I may get into one in the Spring.  Do you run a marathon?
Human 1:	 I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
Human 2:	 No but my boyfriend does. It's the largest running event in the world - I hear it is very fun and challenging!
Human 1:	 It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun
Human 2:	 I like obstacle races as long as we have some sort of obstacles to get around to get through the event!
Human 1:	 Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey
Human 2:	 Yeah Spartan Races are so fun!  Are there any in your area coming up?
Human 1:	 1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.
Human 2:	 I am going to do the Spartan Sprint in August. It's an Ironman race.
Human 1:	 Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.
Human 2:	 Are you competing in the Spartan Sprint or any of the other ones too?
