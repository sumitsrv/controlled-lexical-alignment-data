Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello!
Human 1:	 There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?
Human 2:	 I've volunteered at the events before, but I do not see how I would be allowed to participate since I am not part of an
Human 1:	 Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!
Human 2:	 I have never seen the event before but I'd be so happy to help you out
Human 1:	 Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?
Human 2:	 That's so interesting! I haven't either.  How exciting!  What will you do for the event?
Human 1:	 Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.
Human 2:	 I think I will volunteer for the event with the kids, I have been in one before and it was so fun. 
Human 1:	 Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.
Human 2:	 That would be so great! I think its the first year they are holding this event. What would you like to know before you come with me?
Human 1:	 True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.
Human 2:	 I have been playing for the last few years and am getting ready to start the team volunteer event. That would be great!
Human 1:	 Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?
Human 2:	 Well, I'd have to help you with the logistics. We will be meeting around 8pm next Saturday and plan on playing games
Human 1:	 Thanks.
