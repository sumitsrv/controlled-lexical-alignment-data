Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Good afternoon!
Human 1:	 How has your week been?
Human 2:	 Well. I went into labor on Sunday! I am having a boy! Its an absolute joy!
Human 1:	 I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.
Human 2:	 I'm doing well, just been getting over a cold. What are you taking for the baby?
Human 1:	 Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.
Human 2:	 I'll probably have the baby tomorrow. I'm so sick too. I'm not allowed to even eat for another week, and its so hot out
Human 1:	 Do you have big plans?
Human 2:	 Wow you must be really excited, I'm sure your excited for the new arrivals. My little one is due December 28th
Human 1:	 I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.
Human 2:	 I'll be going to the beach for like 4 days. I cannot wait
Human 1:	 Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.
Human 2:	 I have never been to the beach ever! It is so far away, I hope it's hot for you as well!
