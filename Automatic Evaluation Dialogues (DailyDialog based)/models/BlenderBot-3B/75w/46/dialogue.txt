Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi
Human 1:	 Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.
Human 2:	 Do you need help?
Human 1:	 My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.
Human 2:	 I think it's good that they invited you because you have to make the friendship work. But don't feel like you are obligated to
Human 1:	 I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's very good that you are putting yourself out there and making amends for their friendship, though they may not want the same thing.
Human 1:	 AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?
Human 2:	 I don't need help from them because they have their own friends now! 
Human 1:	 People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.
Human 2:	 That's what it feels like when I try to hang out with everyone and they just don't want to be around me. It makes me feel like
Human 1:	 Lol. I'm finna be single.
Human 2:	 I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard when they don't have the guts to say that. It can be lonely and I know
