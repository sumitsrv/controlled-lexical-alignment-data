A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hey , what's up ? 
A|2| Human 1: _what_ _do_ _you_ _think_ _about_ human _like_ _chat_ _bots_ ? 
B|3| Human 2: hello ! [what] does _a_ [chat] bot [do] ? _can_ [you] tell me _a_ little [about] _it_ ? 
A|4| Human 1: yep , _we_ seemed _to_ _have_ _made_ some _great_ _progress_ over last few years . [do] [you] _think the_ positives outweigh _the_ negatives 
B|5| Human 2: hello . _i [think_ the] [progress] in _ai_ _is_ _pretty good_ . i'm looking forward [to] _it_ becoming _more_ intelligent . 
A|6| Human 1: _like_ impersorsination ? though [it] sounds far fetched :) 
B|7| Human 2: well , [the] imperssination _is_ _a_ [great] programm _that_ _is_ [made] for _ai research_ _and_ [it] [have] been _on the_ news . 
A|8| Human 1: true [that] ! some of these _bots are_ very engaging [and] funny . _they are_ now _good at_ _even_ _sarcasm_ [i] wonder how far _are_ _we_ from [the] time these _bots_ _start_ giving monologues :) 
B|9| Human 2: [they are] [the] best ! [i] am hoping [that] [they] _will_ become _more_ intelligent [and] [start] [to] communicate in _a_ way [to] where [they] [have] emotions [like] humans [and] 
A|10| Human 1: [i think] [it] [can] take many different forms as [a] product . [the] [research] implication [is] also huge ! [it] [will] signify how [ai research] has progressed so far [and] better place [to] tackle [more] futuristic problems 🙂 sort of [like] stepping [on the] moon 🙂 [i] _might be_ overselling [it] here 😛 
B|11| Human 2: [i [think] the] first ais [that] [will] give [good] , real answers [are] [a] ways off , but [we] [might be] able [to] get close enough [to] get [a] 
A|12| Human 1: _the current_ auto-suggestions already [do] [pretty good] 🙂 
B|13| Human 2: [the current] impresions [bots are] [good at] reading emotions [like] [sarcasm] [and] [even] [the] way [the] person speaks but [they] don t [have] [the] ability 
A|14| Human 1: haha , [pretty] far fetched 🙂 nice having this conversation with [you] ! 
B|15| Human 2: nicely put , [i] agree !
