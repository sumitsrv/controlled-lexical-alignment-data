Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey, whats up?
Human 1:	 I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?
Human 2:	 Whats up with you? Did you not make it to the lectures that you were suppose to attend last week?
Human 1:	 I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?
Human 2:	 Hey there, I did, but time was an obstacle for me as well. I have some homework I was supposed to do today,
Human 1:	 No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?
Human 2:	 Hey its fine for me, I'll have some time in the afternoon
Human 1:	 Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.
Human 2:	 I'm doing a lot better, have plenty of time for lectures now
Human 1:	 True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.
Human 2:	 Its going well! But the time to finish the test will be hard though, I have a ton of reading to do. 
Human 1:	 Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.
Human 2:	 That's great, you must be really ready for the November exam
