Human 2:	 I am doing great! What are you looking forward to doing this weekend?
Human 1:	 yea me too. I sometimes eat noodle soups in thanksgiving instead haha
Human 2:	 I am going to eat some noodle soups too and binge watch Netflix, you?
Human 1:	 me neither. someone told me that it depends on the stuffing inside the Turkey. some people make very good stuffing
Human 2:	 i like stuffing sometimes too and some make it in a different way that I dont like it and i can eat the other stuffing instead
Human 1:	 yea. what do you plan to buy?
Human 2:	 I'm probably going to buy a bunch of stuffing because it's cheap and good for the holidays.
Human 1:	 ah cool. so you can run more frequently?:)
Human 2:	 I can't run anymore... I was in a terrible accident and broke my leg, but I plan on going to the gym more instead.
Human 1:	 yay, all the best with keeping calories in check!
