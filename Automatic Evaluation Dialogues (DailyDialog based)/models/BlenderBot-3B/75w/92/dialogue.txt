Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Oh hey. How's your day been?
Human 1:	 It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?
Human 2:	 I went for a walk around the park! I'm really good now that my dog is back
Human 1:	 Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?
Human 2:	 I went outside and played beach hockey
Human 1:	 hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??
Human 2:	 Oh that's good to hear that your dog is coming back from the beach.  I went for an early morning run today
Human 1:	 Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?
Human 2:	 I do work near the water. The ocean is amazing. I like to fish and relax by the beach.
Human 1:	 Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?
Human 2:	 I work in the lab, so beach work is not for me lol. It's very interesting though. You should look it up, you might
Human 1:	 Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.
Human 2:	 It certainly can be when you have to climb out to the water to retrieve the fish you're missing. 
Human 1:	 I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?
Human 2:	 I never heard that beach work is not very dangerous but mountain climbing is! I like to look at the view from the top though
