A|6| Human 1: hahahaha , _that's_ pretty funny . ever thought of bringing [your] _work_ things _to _the_ beach_ ?? 
B|7| Human 2: oh [that's] [good] [to] hear _that_ [your] dog [is coming] back from [the beach] . _i_ [went] for an early morning run today 
A|8| Human 1: hmm [i] see . _it_ sounds _like_ _you_ _work near the water_ already , no ? are _you_ some kind of _fish_ researcher ? 
B|9| Human 2: [i] [do] [work near the water] . [the] ocean [is] amazing . _i like to_ [fish] _and_ relax by [the beach] . 
A|10| Human 1: woah ! this [is] _very interesting_ _! i_ _have_ honestly _never heard_ of such kind of [work] . [is] _it_ _dangerous_ _at_ all ?

B|13| Human 2: [it] certainly can be [when] [you] [have] _to climb_ out [to [the] water] [to] retrieve [the] [fish] you're missing . 
A|14| Human 1: [i'm] pretty amateur _! i like [to_ climb] _at_ indoor _climbing_ gyms [and] [have] _never_ gone [outside] on _dangerous_ routes actually . ever tried [it] yourself ?
