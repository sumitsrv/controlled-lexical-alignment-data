Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 yo! what brought you here
Human 1:	 Just looking to chat. Yourself?
Human 2:	 Just looking at my new pets that I just got in the mail! How are you today?
Human 1:	 I am just enjoying a cigar at the moment. How about yourself?
Human 2:	 My boyfriend is on vacation so I am just going nuts about the little things for now. How are you?
Human 1:	 This one is actually from Peru, which is more my taste. Smoking isn't very healthy, but it's actually quite relaxing, which in a way is good for your health. haha
Human 2:	 I enjoy the taste of cigars, but it's hard for me to smoke them often because I'm worried about all of the health risks.
Human 1:	 haha "You only live once" as they say!
Human 2:	 Hi, I'm good. What kind of pets do you have? My cats love me very much. Yes it is, but they smell like
Human 1:	 haha, that is not what I was getting at, but yes that would be nice. Do you believe in reincarnation?
Human 2:	 haha that's true. Do you believe it's more relaxing to not have to worry about your health? I have a cat and 2 dogs
Human 1:	 Do you think Neural Link will allow you to live after death? I thought it was just a brain-computer interface.
Human 2:	 Yes, but that's not going to happen lol. I believe in reincarnation as a spirit or energy that transfers to the after
Human 1:	 Ahh I see. That is a much harder task, no?
Human 2:	 I think so. It will just be a bit harder because I have brain injuries that have caused memory loss, but maybe not.  
Human 1:	 Depends on how good the brain dump is I suppose...
