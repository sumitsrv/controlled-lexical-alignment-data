Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi, how are you?
Human 1:	 I'm doing great. what are you up to?
Human 2:	 I am doing great! Just got done doing laundry. I do not know what I would do with out my dryer
Human 1:	 oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?
Human 2:	 I'm reading "The Catcher in the Rye", I just started reading it for a school book report last week.
Human 1:	 that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?
Human 2:	 Its a book that came out recently, I am reading it for school also. It really helps you see the world through another persons view when you
Human 1:	 I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Human 2:	 I just finished the book "Oliver Twist", its a classic that is pretty good read
Human 1:	 it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian
Human 2:	 I have never read it, but I know it's considered by some as a classic and for young adults, like myself, that's interesting! 
Human 1:	 I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian
Human 2:	 I will for sure give it a read, that seems like a good book! It is nice having other people you can relate with, you know
Human 1:	 yup!
