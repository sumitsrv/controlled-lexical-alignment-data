Human 1:	 Hi.
Human 2:	 Helloooooo!
Human 1:	 How are you? How is your day?
Human 2:	 Hello! It was nice talking to you!
Human 1:	 I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.
Human 2:	 My day was good so now I'm getting ready to relax by the fireplace with some wine. How about you?
Human 1:	 Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?
Human 2:	 I do not, but it's good to have a positive outlook on things! It keeps your spirits up!
