Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hey
Human 1:	 is it raining pretty bad today?
Human 2:	 I'm a little annoyed that I have to take my kids to school, but not enough to go out an buy a rain coat right now!
Human 1:	 surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy
Human 2:	 It is raining pretty hard here too. How much are you out?
Human 1:	 Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...
Human 2:	 I am in Florida, and the rain has been bad.
Human 1:	 Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms
Human 2:	 The weather there is horrible! I am up north, we had floods this year that caused damage to our house
Human 1:	 people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area
Human 2:	 I live in Florida too where the summer has been very rainy.
Human 1:	 hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?
Human 2:	 I feel the same way! The rain has been so heavy here this year! Are you okay? 
Human 1:	 they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.
