Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how are you doing?
Human 1:	 I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Human 2:	 I want to skydive so bad! I'm afraid I'll freak out though.
Human 1:	 Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Human 2:	 Seville, Spain is beautiful, I've been there once, it's a great place to visit!
Human 1:	 Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Human 2:	 No i havent, i'm scared too, but maybe someday I will go! Have you ever gone before?
Human 1:	 Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
Human 2:	 I haven't. It's just not my style, really. I've watched people skydive, though... Have you? It was quite cool
Human 1:	 White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
Human 2:	 I'm thinking about going to Europe, and Sevilla is high on my list, but I've never been on a skiing vacation before
Human 1:	 I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Human 2:	 I've never been skiing myself so I'm not the guy to ask, but my boyfriend is from Spain and he tells me how much
Human 1:	 Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
