Human 2:	 Hi James! I'm doing wonderful thank you! Just got my cat from the shelter and he just woke me up from a nap today
Human 1:	 same here! I hope the weather will be nice
Human 2:	 I'm feeling much better today. I hope the same for you. What is going on in your life?
Human 1:	 oh no, which areas will be affected?
Human 2:	 Well the hurricanes are supposed to hit here pretty hard so I hope none of you are affected too bad.
Human 1:	 uh oh, I'd better not to plan for BBQ then instead just enjoying playing board games inside 🙂
Human 2:	 I know it's just a little rain, but it still freaked me out! I had a plan on making a BBQ for lunch, but
Human 1:	 yea, you'd better check. where do you live?
Human 2:	 I'd better not check any further because I have plans for later this evening
Human 1:	 gotcha. anything you love about where you live?
Human 2:	 I live in the midwest, so I love how little we get hurricanes!  We rarely ever get anything stronger than a little
Human 1:	 nice! I'd love to come visit that area some times
