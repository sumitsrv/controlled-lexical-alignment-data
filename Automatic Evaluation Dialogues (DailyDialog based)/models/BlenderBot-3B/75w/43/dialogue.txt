Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hi there!
Human 1:	 are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?
Human 2:	 Hello! I hope it's a good one. My mentor told me she's the best
Human 1:	 either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful
Human 2:	 I'm glad you are getting mentorship from someone! 
Human 1:	 I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .
Human 2:	 Yes, it is very interesting to have someone else mentor you.  I have a good idea on how to handle this type of stuff now though
Human 1:	 yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.
Human 2:	 Yes 1:1 is very convenient but sometimes 2 is better because you can see the other person as much as possible in your daily life
Human 1:	 Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?
Human 2:	 Yeah!  And you also get to learn things from them that are specific to the person you're mentoring with, but it is good that you
Human 1:	 Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
Human 2:	 I hope they are patient with me.  I've been trying to learn but this will be my first time working with a mentor.
Human 1:	 Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉
