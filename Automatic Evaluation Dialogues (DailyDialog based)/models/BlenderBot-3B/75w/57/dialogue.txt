Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, how's your day going?
Human 1:	 okayish, it is flying by quicker than I expected. How is your day going on?
Human 2:	 Hey there! Just playing with my dog, it's going well.
Human 1:	 Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.
Human 2:	 I'm going to be writing a paper today and I've been pacing around all day, I'm so nervous. I would love to be at
Human 1:	 wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.
Human 2:	 I've been working for a week off and on and have only attended meetings today!
Human 1:	 Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?
Human 2:	 That sounds fun. Do you work at a desk or on the floor.
Human 1:	 Nice, what all places would you be going to?
Human 2:	 I would be going to the local coffee shop and playing chess all day.
Human 1:	 I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!
Human 2:	 I'm sorry you have that much work to do but I'm going with them to the beach. I love diving, I went the first
Human 1:	 That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive
Human 2:	 I would like to travel to the beach! It's one of my very favorite places to go diving, with its gorgeous sunset
Human 1:	 woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)
Human 2:	 Oh man, that's unfortunate. It would be really interesting for sure though, but maybe not the best idea to do it all the time
Human 1:	 you are a kind soul!
