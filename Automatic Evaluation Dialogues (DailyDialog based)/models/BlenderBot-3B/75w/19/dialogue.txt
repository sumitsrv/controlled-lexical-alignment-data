Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with 🙂
Human 1:	 I am the superman! What about you?
Human 2:	 You are the superman? Can you fly faster than the speed of sight with your x-ray vision?
Human 1:	 Being invisible. You won't see me.
Human 2:	 I can see you, just invisible to me ;-)
Human 1:	 I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!
Human 2:	 You would rather trust machine learning and fMRI? I'd rather not.  I've got to see a doctor soon to have an X
Human 1:	 The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.
Human 2:	 Oh? So you are having an MRI to find out why you are not seeing brain activity?
Human 1:	 I believe in Science! Science is my god!
Human 2:	 Science has so many different interpretations of what is right and wrong, I can not be sure it is right for the brain scan.
Human 1:	 no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?
Human 2:	 I would rather not. I'd rather the machine learning and fMRI can do that for me if possible
Human 1:	 Does it make sense?
Human 2:	 I'm not sure what you mean. What can science do for you?
