A|0| Human 1: hi ! 
B|1| Human 2: hello , who _am_ _i_ having _the_ pleasure _to_ chat with 🙂 
A|2| Human 1: [i] [am] _the superman_ ! _what_ about _you ?_ 
B|3| Human 2: [you] are [the superman] ? _can_ [you] fly faster than [the] speed of sight with your x-ray vision ? 
A|4| Human 1: being _invisible_ . [you] won't _see_ _me_ . 
B|5| Human 2: [i] _can_ [see] [you] , just [invisible] _to_ [me] ;-) 
A|6| Human 1: _i _would rather_ trust_ _fmri_ _and_ _machine learning_ [to] _do_ this . [i] [am] _not_ _an_ expert on _that_ . sorry _for_ _it_ ! 
B|7| Human 2: [you] [would rather trust] [machine learning] [and] [fmri] ? i'd [rather] [not] . i've got [to] [see] _a_ doctor soon [to] have [an] x 
A|8| Human 1: _the brain_ imaging thing _that_ [can] tell [you] [a] brain's _activity_ at [a] pretty high resolution . 
B|9| Human 2: oh ? so [you] are having [an] mri [to] find out why [you] are [not] seeing [brain] [activity] ? 
A|10| Human 1: [i] believe in _science_ ! _science_ _is_ my god ! 
B|11| Human 2: [science] has so many different interpretations of [what] [is] right [and] wrong , [i] [can] [not] be sure [it] [is] right [for] [the brain] scan . 
A|12| Human 1: no , _i'm_ bad at [science] _. what can science do_ ? [is] [it] [the] most important thing [for] society ? 
B|13| Human 2: [i would rather] [not] . i'd [rather] [the] [machine learning] [and] [fmri] [can] [do] [that] [for] [me] if possible 
A|14| Human 1: does [it] make sense ? 
B|15| Human 2: [i'm] [not] sure [what] [you] mean [. what can science do] [for] [you ?]
