Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey, what's up?
Human 1:	 Just chillin'. how are you?
Human 2:	 Just doing some light shopping! Getting my life together
Human 1:	 Do anything interesting today?
Human 2:	 Not really, just hanging out. What are you up to today?
Human 1:	 Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!
Human 2:	 Just finished working out and am ready to play video games after that. What kind of amusement park went you?
Human 1:	 It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 It's funny that you ask because, I was literally at Kingda Ka the next week and it is indeed the world's tallest. 
Human 1:	 Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?
Human 2:	 Wow that's cool. I'm not really much of a rollercoaster kinda guy but I've heard they're fun. My brother works there
Human 1:	 Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha
Human 2:	 Yes I am and it was scary haha. I'm not the biggest fan of rollercoasters, but I rode Kingda Ka
Human 1:	 Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?
Human 2:	 I have to admit I like it the best because the height makes it a thrill when you go up and you can lean back and not worry about
