Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hey!
Human 1:	 How's your day going?
Human 2:	 Hello, I am okay I guess, I am just tired from walking so much. How are you?
Human 1:	 I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!
Human 2:	 It's going well, I'm getting ready for bed now
Human 1:	 Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?
Human 2:	 I've seen them play the lakers a few times. I used to watch them alot in the old arena
Human 1:	 Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!
Human 2:	 I love the Grizzlies. The NBA team right?
Human 1:	 Oh cool! What is "NeurIPS"?
Human 2:	 I love the Grizzlies too. What about a team with their name? I don't know, maybe the Golden State Warriors.
Human 1:	 Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?
Human 2:	 The New York chairs. Sounds like a cool team name. What is it about that name that you love?
Human 1:	 Oh, ML?
Human 2:	 They are the Memphis Grizzlies I love that they play in the most populous city in the united states
Human 1:	 Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?
Human 2:	 A movie about AI? that sounds interesting. I really like the New York Knicks, I like basketball, so the NJ Nets being called
