B|5| Human 2: [well] i've [been] [sick] [and] achy _but_ [i just want [to] relax] [for the holidays and] _have_ time off work ! 
A|6| Human 1: definitely _! i know_ [a] lot _of_ folks travel [for the holidays] _, _but_ i'm happy to_ _stay home_ myself !

A|14| Human 1: [oh] , [very] clever pun [! _i] like_ [it] ! depends [. i] remember [having] _real_ _christmas_ _trees_ from childhood [, but] these days [with] climate change , [i] think not chopping down [a] [tree] [just] [to] decorate [it] [and] then throw [it] [out] in [a] month [is] [the] more responsible thing [to] [do] . 
B|15| Human 2: [i like] [the] [tree] [but] hate [the] decorations 
A|16| Human 1: admit [my] favorite store [is] target , plus _they_ often [have] good deals .
