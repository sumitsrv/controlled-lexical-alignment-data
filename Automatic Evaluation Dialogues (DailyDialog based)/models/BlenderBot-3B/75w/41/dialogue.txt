Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Do you believe in miracles?
Human 1:	 Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.
Human 2:	 I know, what sucks is I feel so guilty for having been treated so badly, people suck
Human 1:	 It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.
Human 2:	 It's a miracle I got my first promotion, and then another one when I was out sick for three days in a row.
Human 1:	 Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?
Human 2:	 It's not about what you believe in, its about how well you can act on them, which you can't and the people who treated you wrong
Human 1:	 We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.
Human 2:	 That's the good part about getting older and wiser, you get to know not to take people's crap too much anymore.
Human 1:	 It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?
Human 2:	 It does explain my career path. I got a good promotion this year after a lot of hard work and sacrifice. 
Human 1:	 ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?
Human 2:	 I can attest.
