Human 1:	 Hi!
Human 2:	 Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
Human 1:	 It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?
Human 2:	 Yes I do! I don't even know you but I remember where I met you.
Human 1:	 Did we dance together perchance?
Human 2:	 Did you take dance lessons at the YMCA?
Human 1:	 Lol. Were you schwasty?
Human 2:	 Yes!  Were you the one that asked how I had gotten so good? I was so impressed.
Human 1:	 I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?
Human 2:	 I don't think so, but I'm really impressed you have a private practice in Palo Alto. You must be really talented and well
Human 1:	 I'm not sure I know what that is.
Human 2:	 I'm not sure either, but I know that I am sore all over today...but I will get over it soon. It is what it
Human 1:	 Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?
Human 2:	 Yes, that's me, I really admire the science and hard work you guys have got but it's not something I could get into.
